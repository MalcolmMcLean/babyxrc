        <p>Chapter 8. <B>Half term</B></p>
        
        <p>&quot;Next weekend is half term and those of you whose parents are able to come, they will visit for the day&quot; said brother Dominic, &quot;so I want St Tom's looking at its best. Scrub out all those dorms, don't let them see the messy way in which you live.&quot;  &quot;We've just been scrubbing out kitchens all day, Sir&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Which is your own silly fault. Dorms, pristine. Oh&quot;, and he lowered his voice confidentially, &quot;I don't think we need to tell any parents about night sailing, do we.&quot;  The boys sighed and got down to tidying out the dorm.  Adam gave the window latch a good polish, and it came loose.  &quot;Badly maintained buildings&quot; he said.  &quot;Let's have a look&quot; said James, and elbowed Adam out of the way, &quot;you know something, that's been unscrewed.&quot;  &quot;They've cut the screws off just leaving a couple of millimetres&quot; said Albert, &quot;that way it still holds in, but you can get the latch off, without getting a screwdriver to it each time.&quot;  &quot;Who would do that?&quot; asked Adam.  James slapped him on the back, &quot;To get out, you dope.&quot;  &quot;We can get out the front door&quot;  &quot;By grace of brother Dominic&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;Father Abbot told us that he keeps a watch on the door and he knew.&quot;  &quot;We've been insulting his intelligence&quot; said James, &quot;but this way we can get out, genuinely in secret. Imagine us not finding that out sooner.&quot;  &quot;Second years must think we're idiots&quot; said Albert.  &quot;OK,&quot; said James, &quot;we case every latch, every hinge, everything with a lock on it. Let's find out what else has been done.&quot;  The soon found that the carpet had been untacked at one corner. It could be folded back, revealing bare floorboards. Albert instantly realised that one of these could be raised. It had been planed so that it fitted loosely, and the nails had been cut off with a hacksaw. The space below was empty, but smelt faintly like a pub.  &quot;This is where they keep their stash of beer&quot; said James, &quot;we didn't know anything about this. Literally nothing. We've been so slow.&quot;  &quot;It's open to the whole space under the floor boards&quot; said Adam, &quot;you could put anything down here&quot;  &quot;Careful of the ceiling, though&quot; said Albert, &quot;It's just plasterboard, it won't bear any weight. I'll get some plywood in next thing and rest it on the joists. Then it will be safer.&quot;  &quot;Now we just need some beer to go into it&quot; said James.  &quot;I don't like beer&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Have you had it?&quot; asked James.  &quot;Yes, my parents gave me a little bit, when they were together. But just to see how horrible it was&quot; Adam said.  &quot;I don't like it either&quot; said James.   &quot;Ginger beer, maybe&quot; said Adam.  &quot;That's too girly. Midnight feats, that what girls do.&quot; said James  &quot;No they don't.&quot; said Adam, &quot;we have actual girls here, in case you hadn't noticed.&quot;  &quot;Well someone drinks ginger beer&quot; said Albert, &quot;or no-one would manufacture it.&quot;  &quot;It's drunk with whiskey&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;whiskey American. My father has it all the time.&quot;  &quot;And do you like it?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;No, it's gingery with a sort of nasty kick. Suitable only for Americans, in my opinion.&quot;  &quot;Don't let blonde Mary hear you say that&quot; said Adam.  &quot;OK,&quot; said James, &quot;so there's none of us like beer. Which raises the question, what is to go down here?&quot;  &quot;Contraband&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Obviously&quot; said James, &quot;I mean what.&quot;  &quot;Anything we can get out of the kitchen&quot; said Albert.</p>
        
        <p>  The revenge that Abagail predicted was not long in coming. The prefects held a meeting every week, and the subject of the stolen dinghy inevitably came up.  &quot;Those first years are getting a bit uppity&quot; said one, &quot;we would never have dared to take a boat, when we were that age.&quot;  &quot;I just wish they'd all been drowned&quot; said another.  &quot;Don't be silly,&quot; said a third, &quot;I wouldn't wish that on anyone. But what was Fr Abbot thinking of? One little run, and some kitchen duty. Like that's going to punish them?&quot;  &quot;Well what can he do? He can't exactly have them shot at dawn. That's not allowed.&quot;  &quot;It was our boat. If we don't do something then sailing will be taken away from us, so that first years can't kill themselves at night.&quot;  &quot;So take them out and keelhaul them.&quot;  &quot;Keelhaul?&quot;  &quot;You pass a rope round the dinghy, and tie the first year to the rope. Then you pull until he goes round and comes up the other side.&quot;  &quot;It might destabilise it.&quot;  &quot;Then we'd possibly have a dead first year on our hands, and Fr Abbot none too happy. Loss of a set of fees. No, we've got be responsible about this. He's dished out the punishment, it's not for us to be seen to undermine him.&quot;  &quot;Well just dunk them in the sea at night again.&quot;  &quot;That spoils it. You only do that once.&quot;  &quot;I've got a better idea. You know that Adam dished up poison against Rupert.&quot;  &quot;Served Rupert right. Never liked him.&quot;  &quot;No it didn't. He could have been killed.&quot;  &quot;Well he's not getting my vote for prefect next year.&quot;  &quot;Sean wanted that hushed up.&quot;  &quot;Sean did right. Adam's half crazy, you realise that?&quot;  &quot;How come his sister is normal?&quot;  &quot;I don't know, look, this is getting off the point. The first years have a reputation for dishing out poison. So why don't we all pretend to be really ill, with a stomach upset? Then we say that the first years have been moaning about their kitchen duty, which they have, especially Cecilia, that spoilt brat. So the monks put two and two together, and bang, our first years in deep doo-doo.&quot;  &quot;Brilliant. But why not spike the food with real poison?&quot;  &quot;Oh no, I'm not getting into that. Not poison, please spare us. We all just trog along to the sick bay - everyone on prefects' table - and moan and moan and moan about the agony we're in. Then put in a formal complaint to Fr Abbot about catering standards.&quot;  &quot;The food could do with being improved&quot;  &quot;Exactly. Monks can eat porridge and soggy vegetables, but most of us aren't going to be monks.&quot;  &quot;I am.&quot;  &quot;Well other monasteries aren't like this. They have nice food.&quot;  &quot;We've got an exemption from the prohibition on red meat. I think the brothers feel a bit guilty about it. So they have horrible cooking to compensate.&quot;  &quot;To keep us in line, more like.&quot;  &quot;Anyway, that's the plan. It gets the first years into trouble, and it gets us a complaint in about the food without antagonising Fr Abbot. Two birds with one stone.&quot;  &quot;I've got an even better idea. Do it at half term, right in front of the parents.&quot;  &quot;Food's always special then.&quot;  &quot;So brother Damian will have the first years in, slaving away. And it will be such an embarrassment when all the prefects come down with food poisoning.&quot;  &quot;Perfect&quot;.  The prefects agreed, the meeting broke up.</p>
        
        <p> Ibrahim's parents were in Pakistan and not coming to the parent's day. Adam and Abagail's family also made their excuses. Mandy's parents were obviously not able to come either, but she had a social worker from the local authority to visit her. Blonde Mary's mother was to fly in especially from America, whilst for Sebastian, Albert and Cecilia there was no problem. For the other two children the choice of parent caused tensions. James' mother was coming, after a bitter quarrel with his father over who should have the privilege. Short Mary had both parents coming, something she dreaded.   &quot;OK, I understand that Alex has managed to persuade Mummy that the journey from London is too far,&quot; said Abagail, &quot;but why isn't Daddy coming? I want so much to see him.&quot;  &quot;Probably because Alex is paying for us&quot; said Adam, &quot;it creates a bit of an embarrassing situation. The thing is, it's really a chance for the parents to see Fr Abbot. They see us as an afterthought. But Daddy is the non-custodial parent, so he's no right to make any decisions about our education.&quot;  &quot;I thought he chose St Tom's for us&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;He did, Abbey, he did. But that was informal, you see. Alex just wants us out. He couldn't care less where we go, or what the standard of teaching is like, or if we're happy there. I suspect he couldn't even care what it costs, he's got money. So he might as well let Daddy choose the school. And it prevents any moaning from Mummy.&quot; Adam was getting angry, &quot;The fact is we've got no parents, unlike anyone else except Ibrahim, and he's got an obvious reason.&quot;  &quot;And Mandy&quot;  &quot;And Mandy, but even she's got someone from the council coming to see her.&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Poor Mandy&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;Well you sent her to Coventry&quot; said Adam.  &quot;And the boys as well&quot; said Abagail, &quot;the fact is we had to protect Cecilia.&quot;  &quot;So I suppose we're stuck on the island&quot; said Adam, &quot;whilst the others are taken on trips by their parents.&quot;  &quot;Suppose so&quot; said Abagail, &quot;anyway, I like the island. It won't be so bad, just you and me together&quot;  &quot;And Ibrahim&quot; said Adam.  &quot;And Ibrahim, I forgot about him&quot; said Abagail.</p>
        
        <p> The week leading up to half term passed anxiously. Brother Bernard went into panic mode. &quot;For crying out loud, Adam&quot; he said in final exasperation, &quot;just open and close your mouth but do not sing if you cannot even time the notes correctly.&quot;  Adam burst into tears, at which point brother Bernard sighed deeply.  &quot;It is solemn high Mass for the parents&quot; he said, &quot;and we just do not have this together. The organ needs replacing, everything needs practising. Why we don't have a proper choir school I don't know. Now remember that most of the parents are shaky on Latin, so you have to enunciate clearly. They want to hear the words match what is printed in their books. Which means that you have got to understand what you are singing. Gloria in excelsis Deo. Who understands that?&quot;  &quot;Glory to God in the highest&quot; said everyone.  &quot;OK, that is easy. Et in terram pacem hominae bonae voluntatis.&quot;  &quot;And peace to his people on Earth&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;No, I said listen to the Latin. Doesn't brother Dominic teach you Latin?&quot;  &quot;Well that's what we say at Mass&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;It's a loose translation&quot; said Adam.  &quot;So what does the Latin say&quot; said brother Bernard, &quot;anyone?&quot;  &quot;And on the Earth be peace to men who volunteer to do good.&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Did anyone tell you that, or did you translate it yourself?&quot; asked brother Bernard.  &quot;I did it myself&quot; said Adam.  &quot;A good attempt&quot; said brother Bernard, &quot;OK, we'll go with your translation for now.&quot;  &quot;But that doesn't mean the same thing as 'peace to his people on Earth' &quot; said Cecilia, &quot;not at all&quot;.  &quot;No&quot;, said Adam.    &quot;How did you know that&quot; asked blonde Mary after the lesson, &quot;when we haven't come to it in Latin lessons yet?&quot;  &quot;You look at the words and guess&quot; said Adam, &quot;somehow it seems to have meaning.</p>
        
        <p> Brother Damian was less panicy. Older, he was unworried what the parents would think. However he was glad to have extra help from the first years, to ease the burden of preparing for the big day. There was to be a formal dinner at noon on Sunday, following the Mass.  Abagail and Cecilia were set to rolling pastry. It came in big frozen slabs that had to be defrosted in the microwave. Then you had to roll it to size and cut it into shapes. The trimmings went to a pie for regular dinner, however brother Damian was fussy about not wasting too much. You also had to roll out the pastry evenly. Too much pressure on one side or the other would cause it to rise in a lopsided manner. Brother Damian showed them how to roll with many light strokes. The first few were not too bad, but there were pastry cases for over three hundred people to prepare. Abagail fairly soon wished she would never see another slab of pastry in her life.  Albert and James scrubbed out the kitchen. Brother Damian wanted it especially clean, because he knew that things would be reduced to chaos on the big day, and it didn't do to have food lying about on surfaces that were dirty. His main headache, however, was supplies. Everything had to come in by boat, which ran every week. If by some chance he forgot to order some item, it was expensive and inconvenient to order the boat out again for a special trip, so unless it was completely vital they would simply do without. Adam and Albert were put in charge of documenting the supplies.  &quot;Count everything&quot; said brother Damian, &quot;what we have goes in this column here. Here's what we ought to have. What ought to be isn't always what is, sometimes it will be higher, sometimes lower. Usually lower, because people use things without signing for them. But don't just accept it, look for things. And tidy everything as you go.&quot;  Adam grinned at Albert.  &quot;Double entry accountancy&quot; said Albert, &quot;you enter everything twice.&quot;  &quot;I really wouldn't know&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Oh, it's surprisingly technical&quot; said Albert, &quot;I'm going to be an accountant.&quot;  &quot;This is carte blanche&quot; said Adam.  &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Albert.  &quot;Just fiddle the numbers, we can take what we want&quot; said Adam.   The stores were stuffed full of marvellous things. Row upon row of tins, sacks spilling beans and nuts and sugar and flour. There was an entire box full of blocks of chocolate, and another full of massive tins of honey. Then there were the fresh vegetables, carrots, onions, garlic.  &quot;Carrots taste better raw&quot; said Adam, &quot;why does he have to ruin them by cooking them?&quot;  &quot;We can't count all these in place&quot; said Albert, &quot;you move them, I'll keep tally. That way we get through them faster than if we try to count separately.&quot;  &quot;Honey, we'll have one of these tins. Chocolate, when have we had chocolate for dinner?&quot;  &quot;Careful&quot; said Albert, &quot;that means he might have it counted.&quot;  They consulted with James and Sebastian.  &quot;The thing is&quot; said James, &quot;when it is newly in, and a round number, probably he knows it's a new delivery and no-one has taken anything, so leave that alone. But if odds and ends from months ago are lying about, he's not going to keep track of that. So fiddle the entry and take some.&quot;  &quot;It's all very well fiddling the entry&quot; said Adam, &quot;but how do we get stuff out?&quot;  &quot;Easy, wrap it up in plastic bags, then Sebastian and I put it in the garbage. We take the garbage out, and we retrieve it at night.&quot; said James.  &quot;Perfect.&quot; said Adam.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Look at this&quot; said Albert, &quot;this entire cellar is full of wine.&quot;  Adam looked, amazed. Bottle after bottle was lined up, most of it new delivery.  &quot;It's for the parent's day&quot; he said.  &quot;Unfortunately a new delivery&quot; said Albert.  They counted it. &quot;Actually,&quot; said Albert, &quot;that is short.&quot;  &quot;Are you sure?&quot;  They tried again. Short by three cases.  &quot;In which case it can be short by four cases&quot; said Adam.  Albert entered the fraudulent figure.  &quot;Four cases is a lot&quot; he remarked, &quot;is this safe?&quot;  &quot;There's plenty of the same label but the previous year. That was obviously the same order for the last parents' day. So he'll have plenty.&quot; said Adam  &quot;Then maybe take from that one.&quot; suggested Albert.  &quot;What do you think?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;Wine is likely to be counted a bit more carefully than other things. So if one is short already, I'd say it's safer to take from that. Besides, I've entered the figure already. Don't cause suspicion.&quot;  &quot;OK&quot; Adam agreed. They rushed the case into the dustbin, both of them carrying it, whilst brother Damien was away. James and Sebastian covered it with rubbish, then wheeled it out.</p>
        
        <p> James also got himself a decent knife.  &quot;That's for killing sheep&quot; he explained.  &quot;I don't think we'll be killing any more sheep&quot; said Adam, &quot;we've been banned from nicking the dinghy again.&quot;  &quot;You never know&quot; said James, &quot;I'm taking it just in case.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> Albert smuggled out a wire grill, and small canister of gas .  &quot;What do you want those for?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;The wire grill is so we don't have to rely on a grill being around next time we have a barbecue. The gas is to make explosives in case I want to blow the place up.&quot;  &quot;Where would you blow up?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;Haven't decided yet&quot; said Albert, &quot;but you can make a nice bomb with a canister of cooking gas.&quot;    At last the final touches were put to Friday prep. The six children who had been on the dinghy went into the kitchen for a final preparation. Normal dinner still had to be cleared up after, then there was all the food to prepare for the big day. The pastries were filled with a mixture of venison and chopped vegetables. They were then put into the fridge, ready to be baked. There were also desserts, made of shortbread, caramel, and chocolate. The chocolate had to be melted in a big pot over boiling water, then poured carefully and spread with a knife. Then came the awful job of cleaning the pot of the solidified chocolate. Abagail had always thought of chocolate as a nice thing, now she realised that it could also be messy. If you kept it cold it was awkward to clean and stuck to the pot like paint, if you warmed it with water it became sticky and horrible, and messed up every surface you were working with. Then it blocked up the sink. However eventually it was completed, and they looked proudly at a clean kitchen and serried ranks of pastries and desserts.  Finally it was Compline, and everything was over. There were no lessons the following Saturday.</p>
        
        <p> The ferry arrived about noon with the first parents. Sebastian's and Cecilia's had obviously got talking on the boat, and walked up from the quay in a foursome. Sebastian's father wore a tweed jacket. He was a medium height, handsome man, with hair that was maybe slightly too long, but still full on top. His mother was taller than he, and elegant. She also wore country clothes, and a waxed jacket that was slightly wet from spray. She looked a little bit eccentric, alongside Cecilia's mother, who was dressed in a smart jacket with big blue spots on it. She wore a fur scarf or warmer. Cecilia's father was a tall, rather serious looking gentleman. He wore glasses, and had lost most of his hair. He was dressed, like Sebastian's father, in tweed, but somehow seemed to cut a more citified, less refined figure.  Cecilia ran to her mother, who hugged her tenderly.   &quot;Cecilia,&quot; she said, &quot;we got your letters and they were so terrible. I was afraid you were unhappy. We can take you back at once, if you don't like it here.&quot;  &quot;Oh no,&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;what would Fr Abbot say? He'd never let any parents come, ever again.&quot;  &quot;So you've settled in&quot; said her father.  &quot;If anyone settles in at St Tom's.&quot; said Cecilia. &quot;We have our ups and our downs, but I wouldn't go to another school, not now. I'd have to make new friends, and it might be even worse than here.&quot;  Her father smiled broadly. &quot;And what about Mandy, is she still your friend?&quot;  &quot;We've had some trouble there&quot; said Cecilia. &quot;It's a bit embarrassing really.&quot;  &quot;It's you we're interested in&quot; said her mother, &quot;as long as you are happy.&quot;  &quot;I'm perfectly happy, Mummy.&quot; said Cecilia, gushingly. &quot;You must meet Abbey, and Mary, and Mary Walker too, I suppose. Mandy too, I suppose, but I'm afraid I've rather fallen out with her.&quot;    Sebastian talked quietly with his parents.  &quot;This is certainly a more dramatic setting than my old place&quot; said his father, &quot;sailing, too. We didn't have sailing at my school.&quot;  &quot;Officially first years aren't allowed to sail&quot; said Sebastian.  &quot;I like your officially&quot; said his father, with a chortle, &quot;don't tell me.&quot;  &quot;Hush&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;spies everywhere.&quot;  &quot;I should hope at least you are allowed to swim&quot; said his mother.  &quot;Too cold&quot; said Sebastian.  &quot;Too cold. Nonsense. We had colder baths at my ladies' college.&quot; said his mother &quot;Swimming is an essential art for a sailor, Sebastian.&quot;  &quot;Honestly, it is too cold&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;we've been in the shallows, of course. But in the deep you can survive about ten minutes, before hypothermia sets in. That's why you have to sail with a lifejacket. That gives you a few hours to be picked up.&quot;  &quot;So do the older ones throw you in?&quot; asked his father, &quot;that's what we would have done, if we were here.&quot;  &quot;Just the once&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;as I said, it's so cold it's actually dangerous.&quot;  &quot;Prudence rather than effeminacy.&quot; said his father.  &quot;How are the others?&quot; said his mother.  &quot;Oh, they're a nice bunch&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;there's only five boys, so we have fun. The only problem is you can't get a decent team together for five-a-side.&quot;  &quot;I knew we should have sent you to a rugby school&quot; said his mother.  &quot;Oh rugby&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;I know I played it at prep school, but to be honest it is the most pretentious game I have ever seen. Even the Americans do football with more style. Football is natural, and you can play it with anyone. We play the local comprehensives and it's great. I just wish we could beat them.&quot;  &quot;Comprehensive schools do have rugby teams&quot; said his father.  &quot;I know, but anybody who is anybody at a comprehensive wants to be a professional footballer. Oh, father.&quot;  &quot;Well, your friend Cecilia certainly has nice parents.&quot; said his father, &quot;so much so that I'm considering a business deal with her father. He can reduce the tax take on our farm by converting part of it to forestry. We don't actually have to plant any more trees, just cut down the occasional one that is already there and, presto, it's a managed forest.&quot;  &quot;We'll leave you gentlemen to work out the details&quot; said his mother, &quot;yes, Sebastian. I never implied that St Tom's was a bad place. I just wondered if you might have preferred a rugby school.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Poor Sebastian&quot; said Abagail, &quot;no wonder he's so uptight.&quot;  &quot;Cecilia's seem nice though&quot;, said Adam.  &quot;I wish ours were together.&quot; said Abagial.  &quot;Or even here&quot;, said Adam, &quot;Never mind. At least no-one can laugh at them.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The boat went back for a second load. Adam was surprised to see Sebastian's mother talking with another man, father of one of the third years. They were laughing, and then she put her hand into his, and squeezed it. Sebastian's father, looking on from some distance, still immersed in conversation with Cecilia's father, didn't seem to mind.  &quot;Daddy would have punched him if he did that with Mummy&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Maybe that's why Sebastian's are together, whilst ours aren't&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;Well Cecilia's are still together, and they don't behave like that&quot; said Adam.</p>
        
        <p>The boat returned with the next load of parents. Adam picked out Albert's father before he had even got off the quay.  &quot;That's got to be Albert's&quot; he said to Abagail, &quot;it's just the spitting image of Albert.&quot;  He was short man, and balding, but Abagail could see what he meant. The mother was plump, and rather frumpish looking. They went up to Albert and took him aside, talking quietly and intensely.  &quot;I can't hear what they are saying&quot; said Adam.  &quot;You're so nosey&quot; said Abagail.</p>
        
        <p> James ran up to his mother. She was small, and frail looking, but with a look of complete determination on her face.  &quot;James&quot;, she said, &quot;I've missed you so.&quot;  &quot;I've missed you too, Mum&quot; said James.  &quot;But you wanted to be here so much, I hope you are not disappointed&quot; said his mother.  &quot;It's not quite what I expected&quot; said James, &quot;but I'm not disappointed.&quot;  &quot;James,&quot; said his mother, &quot;Daddy and I had an argument about money before I set off. You know that we could only just afford to send you here, and now I'm not sure we can keep up with the fees. Do you really want to stay here?&quot;  James' jaw dropped with shock.  &quot;I'm sorry, James&quot; said his mother, &quot;I see how upsetting this is for you. I will really try. But it is better to tell you the truth. That evil man, your father, told me he wouldn't pay his share for you, simply because I said I would go to see you today and not him. No matter that you're going to him in the holiday. When you're at school, you're with neither of us, I said, so his access should be reduced. That's only fair. But he wouldn't see it that way. Anyway, he said he wouldn't pay his share for you any longer. But darling, if you want to stay here I will try, I will try so hard. But if Mummy can't find the money, Mummy can't find the money.&quot;  &quot;I'm in charge of the five-a-side team&quot; said James, &quot;I wouldn't have that anywhere else. I wouldn't be the best, in a bigger school&quot;  &quot;And the monks have told me you're doing so well at maths, and at English. I can't really see the point of you doing Latin but brother Dominic is very pleased with you in that as well. I can see it would be a terrible shame to take you away from here&quot; said his mother.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Good grief&quot; said Adam, &quot;positively embarrassing&quot;.  &quot;Now you're glad Alex didn't come&quot; said Abagail, &quot;just think how mortifying that would have been.&quot;  &quot;Mum, Dad, this is Adam and Abbey, the twins&quot; said Albert.  &quot;Pleased to meet you&quot; said Adam, and shook hands.  &quot;The ferry will only carry a dozen or so people&quot; said Albert's father, &quot;and even then it was a squash. I suppose your folks are still waiting.&quot;  &quot;No&quot;, said Adam, &quot;they're not coming.&quot;  Albert's mother looked cross.  &quot;Adam's probably my best friend&quot; said Albert, &quot;we made a rabbit trap together.&quot;  &quot;And did you catch any rabbits in it?&quot; asked his father.  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Albert, &quot;we had roast rabbit.&quot;  &quot;It was Abbey's idea&quot; said Adam, &quot;Abbey doesn't like the food here.&quot;  &quot;Are you not fed properly?&quot; said his mother anxiously.  &quot;It's not the best, but I'd say its got all the vitamins&quot; said Albert.  &quot;Rank and dire&quot; said Abagail, &quot;we have to supplement our food with things we catch, or else we'd starve. Or at least, get ill. It's the only thing I've got against St Tom's, really.&quot;  &quot;Well maybe it could be improved&quot; said his mother, &quot;I shall mention this to Fr Abbot&quot;  &quot;Please don't&quot; said Albert.  &quot;Please do&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;The thing is&quot; said Adam, &quot;technically we're supposed to be living in poverty. Well that's a bit of a joke since to afford the fees you have to be rich. So by keeping the food simple they're trying to keep standards up, so to speak.&quot;  &quot;Simple!&quot; said Abagail, &quot;you mean awful. I can't believe I'm hearing this from you two. Complain.&quot;  &quot;With the level of fees I'm paying I'd certainly expect adequate food for Albert&quot; said Albert's father.  &quot;It's not as if they don't have nice things in the kitchen&quot; said Albert, &quot;It's the cooking where it goes wrong. But don't worry Dad, Adam wangled us a job in the kitchen and so we sneak things out.&quot;  &quot;Well be careful&quot; said his father, &quot;I don't want you expelled.&quot;  &quot;For taking food from the kitchen?&quot; said his mother, &quot;be realistic.&quot;  &quot;We're lucky to be here, all said and done&quot; said Adam, &quot;there are plenty worse places we could be.&quot;  &quot;You know we have our own water and our own generator?&quot; said Albert, &quot;I've got to show you the generator.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> The next boatload arrived, containing the two Marys' amongst the set of parents.  &quot;You can tell she's a film star&quot; said Adam.  Indeed blonde Mary's mother was easy to spot. She was dressed in a low cut dress, quite inappropriate for the weather. It had long hairy fringes on the neckline and sleeves, with beads threaded onto them. The skirt was mini but at least didn't show her thighs, and there was matching beading on her knee-length boots. What gave it away, though, was a huge pentagram, picked out in red sequins, over her chest. For all that she looked like a teenager, blonde Mary's mother was beautiful. Her complexion was perfect. Her face was regular, but just with a slight mischievous smirk, which she had accentuated with bright red lipstick. Her body was slim and perfectly toned, like an athlete's.  Blonde Mary approached her, suddenly seeming much less the swan and more the ugly duckling, tall, a little too lank, still in brown St Tom's plumage. The two didn't hug, which surprised Adam and Abagail.   &quot;I'm sorry darling,&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;I would have come by helicopter, but Fr Abbot told me at the last moment that a landing wasn't possible. We've left the Merc by the village, and it was an absolutely awful drive up. Four hours sitting in a car. I know you have to do that sort of thing in the States, but in England. The worst was waiting for the ferry. My costume is absolutely ruined by the spray, and there's no way of changing it. I feel like a fish that has suddenly been dragged from the water. So sorry, darling, for you to see me like this.&quot;  &quot;Well never mind Mum&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;seriously, though, Scotland's not the best place. It must be an awful drag coming up. Wouldn't I be better at a school in London, or in New York?&quot;  &quot;No, darling, we've decided on St Tom's for you.&quot; said her mother.  &quot;Why do I have to? None of my friends go here.&quot; said blonde Mary.  &quot;We felt it would give you stability, darling, and academically it's very good&quot; said her mother, forcing a smile as she realised she could be overheard.  &quot;It doesn't have the best academic record in the country, you know&quot; said blonde Mary, pouting.  &quot;That's because it's not as selective.&quot; said her mother, &quot;Darling, this isn't the right place to talk about these matters. Of course Mummy wants you to be happy, and really I'd like you to be with me. But your Daddy and I have agreed, that it's best for you if you stay here, and get the best academic grades you can.&quot;  &quot;Like academic counts for anything&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;but come on Mum, meet my friends. This is Abbey, and her twin brother Adam.&quot;  &quot;Do you also think the school is dreadful?&quot; asked the mother.  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Abagail with a giggle, &quot;hate every minute. But hey, we come out clever. So what's a ruined childhood compared with that?&quot;  &quot;And you too Adam&quot;  &quot;Hate it, Madam, I hate it&quot; Adam assured her.  She made much more of a fuss of Sebastian, and was a bit frosty with Cecilia, but always polite. She talked to Ibrahim at some length about the political situation in Pakistan, then had a brief word with James and with Albert. She then worked her way up to Mandy, who found much favour.  &quot;Mandy's on scholarship&quot; said blonde Mary.  &quot;So I take it you are the cleverest&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, with a smile.  &quot;No, Madam&quot; said Mandy.  &quot;She is clever, though&quot; said blonde Mary.  &quot;My folks at home can't look after me, so I'm sent here instead&quot; explained Mandy.  &quot;The care system is so screwed up that it actually costs less to send a kid here than to keep them in a home&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;so Mandy is here.&quot;  &quot;Mandy, you must come with Mary and me&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;we can't have you on your own, on parent's day.&quot;  &quot;I can't&quot; said Mandy, &quot;I've got my social worker coming.&quot;  &quot;And you like her?&quot; asked blonde Mary's mother.  &quot;Oh yes,&quot; said Mandy, &quot;she's fine.&quot;  &quot;Mandy's probably my best friend&quot; said blonde Mary.  &quot;You see, Mary, don't dismiss St Tom's before you've even settled in. You never know what lovely things might happen to you here.&quot;  As she approached short Mary, who was talking to her parents, there was a sudden awkwardness.  &quot;This is Mary Walker&quot; said blonde Mary, sensing that something was amiss.  &quot;Well, lovely to meet you&quot; said her mother, and shook hands briefly. She turned away. As she left, short Mary's mother was heard to exclaim &quot;Dreadful woman&quot;.</p>
        
        <p> What had happened was that blonde Mary's mother had asked the chauffeur of the Mercedes to make enquiries, after they stopped by the supermarket in the village. She was in a bad mood, because of the length of the car journey, and was still smarting from the rebuff given to her by Fr Abbot over the helicopter landing.  The boat had just made a trip, and short Mary's mother was the only other parent present on the landing. The chauffeur naturally assumed that she was one of the villagers, and asked her for directions to the island. Short Mary's mother told him, civilly enough, that the boat would return within a few minutes. &quot;So I take it we can embark within a few minutes&quot; said the chauffeur. &quot;No,&quot; said short Mary's mother, &quot;you wait until a full complement of passengers have arrived. Then the boat sets off.&quot; &quot;And when will that be?&quot; asked the chauffeur, &quot;Whenever the passengers arrive&quot; said short Mary's mother. Now short Mary's mother didn't realise that the man was a chauffeur. He was uniformed, and she knew he was not a policeman. So she assumed he was a petty official of some kind. When the chauffeur said &quot;that's not acceptable, we will pay full fares for an immediate journey&quot; she looked at him with contempt, as if to say, &quot;who are you to tell the boatman how to run his business?&quot; So she told him that that would unlikely to be possible, and they'd have to wait. He said he'd wait in the car, and she told him that people would queue. So he said he would keep the place for his mistress, who would wait in the car. &quot;Oh no she won't&quot; said short Mary's mother. &quot;She will queue herself, like the rest of us, or the boat's going without her.&quot; Stupidly, the chauffeur still didn't realise that short Mary's mother was a parent, and went back to the Mercedes, reporting to blonde Mary's mother that a villager was being awkward with him, and was insisting that she queue personally for the boat. Understandably, blonde Mary's mother was furious. So she went out herself to try to smooth things over with her charm.  &quot;I'm just in a real hurry to get to the island, love&quot; she said, &quot;I can pay you to make it worth your while.&quot;  &quot;There's a queue&quot; said short Mary's mother, offended.  At this point, short Mary's father drew up in his car.   &quot;This woman is not prepared to queue like the rest of us&quot; said short Mary's mother.  &quot;Some of us are so hung up on things, will you keep my place in the queue for a few moments, darling&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, winking at him.  Of course she had no way of knowing that they were a married and now divorced couple.  &quot;I'm not sure I could do that&quot; said short Mary's father awkwardly, trying to smooth things over between the two women. In the end blonde Mary's mother went into the supermarket, found the boatman's wife, and asked her explicitly if it was OK if her chauffeur kept the place in the queue for her. The boatman's wife said yes, and so she did. Both women retreated, blonde Mary's mother to her Mercedes, short Mary's mother to the head of the queue, fuming.  It was even worse on the actual trip, when the two were jammed together. Blonde Mary's mother accidentally on purpose trod on short Mary's mother's foot, then apologised, but she was so jammed and getting her costume wet with the spray, so could that kind gentleman be so nice as to stand with his weatherproof between her and the sea. Of course he was flattered, and she gave a discreet &quot;sorry love&quot; to his wife and talked to her for the rest of the journey. So blonde Mary's mother took centre stage, whilst short Mary's stood in the bows, being lashed by the spray, and with her former husband not paying any attention. In that situation, they arrived on the island.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;She thinks having a Mercedes entitles her to be so terribly rude to everyone&quot; complained short Mary's mother, &quot;and who was that dreadful jumped up little man? A chauffeur?&quot;  &quot;It's the Merc and having film star looks&quot; said the father, and short Mary's mother glowered at him.  &quot;Mary's mother is a film star&quot; explained short Mary.  &quot;I thought so,&quot; said short Mary's mother, &quot;slept her way to the top, no doubt. Stay away from the daughter, Mary.&quot;  &quot;There's only five of us Mum&quot; said short Mary, &quot;it's not possible not to speak to anybody.&quot;  &quot;Well don't let her influence you. I always thought St Tom's was a no nonsense sort of a place, but you get bad people everywhere.&quot; said her mother.  &quot;I think Mary can choose her own friends&quot; said the father.  &quot;I was advising her. I appreciate that you don't care who she mixes with. Come here a minute&quot; she took him aside.  &quot;I thought we agreed we would not fight over Mary's upbringing&quot; she hissed.  &quot;I am sorry Mary&quot; said her father, &quot;your mother and I, we agreed that this was the best place to send you, to develop a bit of independence. Now the main thing we need to know is, are you happy?&quot;  &quot;Oh, I hate it&quot; said short Mary, &quot;take me away, try somewhere different.&quot;  &quot;In that case we'll discuss it with Fr Abbot&quot; said her father.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Are you really leaving?&quot; said Abagail, &quot;and will your parents let you?&quot;  &quot;I don't know&quot; said short Mary, &quot;but they're discussing it seriously with Fr Abbot, right now.&quot;  &quot;I'll happily discuss your concerns&quot; Fr Abbot told them, &quot;but really I'm not the best person to be talking about this to. Brother Dominic has far more day to day responsibility for the first years.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &quot;I'd say St Tom's is exposing, rather than causing Mary's problems&quot; said brother Dominic. &quot;She could be a reasonably well-adjusted, socially integrated girl. But there's something that makes her lash out against other people, and the other children are beginning to pick up on that, and it makes her unpopular. I don't think she's got the worst problems of any child in first year, however.&quot;  &quot;Then who is that?&quot; asked the mother.  &quot;I couldn't possibly say&quot; said brother Dominic, &quot;we are here to discuss Mary. School can be a very revealing environment. The child is thrown upon his own resources, amongst strangers. But it can also be a concealing one, as children adopt a false persona, to cope. Mary has decided that she must not show any vulnerability, must assert her place in the social pecking order. But that's not true. On its own terms it works for a while, but eventually the absence of real relationships takes its toll, and enmities develop.&quot;  &quot;We should take her away before she digs herself a hole any deeper than she's in&quot; said her father.  &quot;Ultimately it's your decision&quot; said brother Dominic, &quot;as a member of St Tom's, naturally I will almost always urge a pupil to stay. But I think it would give Mary a sense of failure to leave. Let things come to a crisis, and let the crisis happen here, at St Tom's, where things are relatively safe. If you give her the easy way out, you are only storing up trouble for the future.&quot;  &quot;But where are these problems coming from&quot; asked her mother, &quot;if not from St Tom's?&quot;  &quot;St Tom's isn't perfect&quot; said brother Dominic, &quot;but I think we can say we avoid many of the mistakes other schools make. We keep the year groups very small, for instance. Rivalries can't fester, they have to be confronted, because she is with the same five girls, almost 24 hours a day, seven days of the week. It's the same for us monks. We have nowhere to hide. Religious community works, and it can work for Mary.&quot;  &quot;You've convinced me&quot; said her father, &quot;I think she should stay&quot;.  &quot;I think Mary herself should have the final word&quot; said the mother, &quot;and she wants to leave.&quot;  &quot;There's no need to take a decision in a hurry&quot; said brother Dominic, &quot;you are the guardians, not St Tom's, and ultimately you can take her away whenever you please. We do really prefer that she completes at least a term, however, otherwise it is extremely disruptive for the other children.&quot;  With that they left.</p>
        
        <p>After introductions and some drinks, the parents took their offspring into Western Scotland for the evening. St Tom's could not provide accommodation for everyone, and the location was quite remote, so hotels and bed and breakfasts had been booked in the small towns and villages thereabouts.  &quot;Since your parents aren't here&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;my mother and father wondered if you'd like to spend the day with us.&quot;  &quot;Oh thanks, Cecilia&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;I can't&quot; said Adam, &quot;because that would leave Ibrahim as literally the only one. Even Mandy's got someone. I couldn't do that to him.&quot;  &quot;Silly of me&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;of course we can't leave Ibrahim out. I've no doubt at all that my parents will agree to him coming along as well.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> A few minutes later, a second invitiation came from blonde Mary. Her mother was eager to take the twins to dinner. Naturally, they had to decline.  &quot;A pity&quot; said Adam, &quot;blonde Mary's mother would have provided us a decent spread&quot;  &quot;Oh, she's probably a fruititarian or something equally ridiculous&quot; said Abagail, &quot;we're better off with Cecilia's, by miles.&quot;  &quot;I would have thought Albert would have invited us&quot; said Adam, &quot;with us being best friends&quot;.  &quot;Maybe they just didn't think of it&quot; said Abagail.</p>
        
        <p> Mandy's social worker came on the last boat. She was a small, friendly looking woman. She wore no make-up and her clothes were plain and workman like. She shook hands with Mandy and talked to her for a while, then scooted up to see Fr Abbot.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Is the placement successful?&quot; she asked the headmaster.  &quot;Oh yes&quot;, said Fr Abbot, &quot;absolutely&quot;.  &quot;We were worried that the social environment may not be the best, that other children would feel it was inappropriate and exclude her.&quot; said the social worker.  &quot;All children have problems&quot; said Fr Abbot, &quot;and Mandy came to us with more than most. But her presence here is one hundred percent appropriate, be sure of that.&quot;  &quot;Do the other children accept her as an equal?&quot; asked the social worker.  &quot;This is a monastery&quot; said Fr Abbot, &quot;we don't intend to give them the choice.&quot; She took out a sheaf of papers from her briefcase.  &quot;We need to monitor Mandy's progress. I hope you'd be so kind as to help me fill out the personal and social relationships form.&quot; she said.  Father Abbot smiled.  &quot;On a one to ten scale, how would you rate the adequacy of Mandy's skills in relating to other children of her own age in non-formal situations?&quot; she asked.  Father Abbot laughed. &quot;Mandy needs to realise that relating to other children is not a skill.&quot; he said.  &quot;So where would you put it, on one to ten?&quot; asked the social worker.  &quot;You mean her skills in manipulating other children?&quot; he asked.  &quot;No, the adequacy of her skills in relating to other children of her own age in non-formal situations.&quot; said the social worker.  &ldquo;I couldn't possibly say&rdquo;, said Father Abbot.</p>
        
        <p>The bell rang for None and at the instant all the children dropped their conversations, turned their backs on their parents, and filed into the chapel. The parents stood about the courtyard, for a moment bewildered.  &quot;It's the St Tom's way&quot; said Sebastian's father. &quot;Nothing comes before the office.&quot;  &quot;It's almost rude&quot; said Cecilia's mother, who was talking with him.  &quot;Some people will break off their conversations when a mobile phone rings&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;prayer is important to the monks, I respect that.&quot;  &quot;What are you waiting for?&quot; said Sebastian's father, &quot;To the chapel.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The parents arrived just in time. None was in English that day. &quot;Oh God come to out aid&quot; &quot;Oh Lord make haste to help us.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>&quot;Oh Strength and Stay upholding all creation Who ever dost Thyself unmoved abide, yet day by day the light in due gradation from hour to hour though all its changes guide&quot; &quot;Grant to life's day a calm unclouded ending, an eve untouched by shadows of decay, the brightness of a holy deathbed blending with dawning glories of the eternal day.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The hymn continued, then there was a Psalm. Then more prayers, and finally.</p>
        
        <p>&quot;The souls of the faithful by the mercy of God, rest in peace.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Monks ands children knelt for a brief moment, then rose promptly and returned to their business.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;So as I was saying, Mummy,&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;thank you so much for allowing Ibrahim to come along as well.&quot;  &quot;It was good of you to think of him&quot; said her father.</p>
        
        <p>Adam and Abagail and Ibrahim joined Cecilia and her parents on the boat. The village had been turned into a temporary car park, with parental vehicles everywhere. Cecilia's father made for a four by four. There were dog hairs over the back seat, and the carpet was stained with mud.  &quot;Sorry it's a bit squashed&quot; he said.  &quot;We won't mind&quot; said Cecilia. All four children crammed onto the back seat.  &quot;Are you glad to see the back of St Tom's for the day?&quot; asked the father.  &quot;Kind of&quot; said Abagial, &quot;but it's also kind of like home.&quot;  They drove for about an hour through Scottish countryside.  &quot;There's a deer&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;Wild?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;Semi-&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;the big landowners run deer on their forest estates. They make a lot of money out of shooting.&quot;  &quot;Have you been shooting?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;We can't afford deer stalking&quot; said her father.  &quot;We're having venison tomorrow though&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Oh, we have venison all the time&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;But you can't afford to shoot it?&quot; said Adam.  &quot;No.&quot;  The germ of an idea was forming in Abagail's mind.</p>
        
        <p>They turned into a small town, where Cecilia's parents had booked a bed and breakfast and a restaurant. Cecilia's father went into the bed and breakfast to make arrangements for another room.  &quot;There's only one extra room&quot; he said, &quot;you'll have to share.&quot; Then they went into the restaurant, which was an unpretentious place, serving Scottish food. It was Cock-a-leekie soup for starters, chicken and leeks, with prunes and a bit of beef in the bottom of the bowl.  &quot;Scottish food is either really nice or really horrible&quot; said Adam, &quot;like porridge and haggis, or smoked salmon and shortbread.&quot;  &quot;Which is Cock-a-leekie soup?&quot; asked Cecilia's father.  &quot;Really nice.&quot;  &quot;Do you want the crusts cut off your bread?&quot; asked Cecilia's mother.  &quot;Oh, I'd forgotten about that&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;The thing is&quot;, said Abagail, &quot;the food is so horrible at St Tom's that we'd eat anything except.&quot;  &quot;Do you say grace?&quot; said Adam, wondering if he could start eating.  &quot;We do at St Tom's&quot; said Abagail, &quot;every meal&quot;.  &quot;Not in a restaurant, Abbey&quot; said Cecilia's mother.  &quot;Adam is right&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;you should not be ashamed to pray in public.&quot;  &quot;If you want, darling&quot; said her mother.  Cecilia's father made as if to speak, he looked embarrassed, &quot;What do you say at St Tom's?&quot; he asked them.  Adam, Abagail and Cecilia chanted out in unison   &quot;Benedic, Domine, nos et haec tua dona quae de tua largitate sumus sumpturi. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.&quot;  Then they added  &quot; Ad cenam vitae aeternae perducat nos, Rex aeternae gloriae. Amen.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Very good,&quot; said Cecilia's father, &quot;what does it mean?&quot;  &quot;Bless us Oh Lord, and these thy gifts which we are about to receive from thy bounty. Through Christ our Lord&quot; said Adam. &quot;Then the last bit goes, 'May the King of everlasting glory lead us to the banquet of life eternal'. You only say that at evening. We say that every mealtime.&quot;  &quot;It's a lot longer on Sunday&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;Why aren't you joining in, Ibrahim?&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;I don't believe in it&quot; said Ibrahim.  &quot;That's terrible, Ibrahim&quot; said Cecilia.    Cecilia's father poured half a glass of wine for Cecilia, and added water to it.  &quot;We let Cecilia drink wine as long as it has water in it&quot; said Cecilia's mother, &quot;would your parents mind if we let you have some?&quot;  &quot;If they minded they ought to have come&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;Just a glass&quot; said her father.  &quot;Not for me&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;my parents wouldn't like it. Pakistan is full of Muslims, you know. You are whipped if you are caught drinking at school.&quot;  &quot;That's terrible, Ibrahim&quot; said Cecilia.  Cecilia's father poured two glasses for Adam and Abagail. The wine went a pink colour when diluted by the water. They all drank.  &quot;What about that girl, Mandy?&quot; said Cecilia's father, &quot;she's not left at St Tom's, I hope.&quot;  &quot;No, she has a social worker to visit her.&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;The poor girl&quot; said Cecilia's mother.  &quot;It's what she deserves&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;she's a horrible person.&quot;  &quot;Cecilia&quot;, said her father, &quot;you mustn't say that.&quot;  &quot;She attacked me&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;I don't mean just pulled my hair. Really attacked me, kicking and punching, hard, like a little savage. I had bruises for weeks afterwards.&quot;  &quot;Well were you nasty to her?&quot; asked her father.  &quot;Not at all. In fact at first I tried to be her friend. I thought she had been disadvantaged, and wanted to be fair to her&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;So she just attacked you for no reason?&quot; said Cecilia's father.  &quot;No reason&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;Cecilia,&quot; said her father, &quot;do you think that I believe that?&quot;  &quot;Well to be honest I did correct her grammar. She said she'd not sneaked on no-one, and I said it was anyone.&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;You see how that could be offensive&quot; said Cecilia's father.  &quot;Well that doesn't justify what Mandy did&quot; protested Abagail, &quot;she attacked Cecilia like a little thug. But we punished her. She doesn't go to any of our things.&quot;  &quot;You're going to get that&quot; said Cecilia's father, &quot;children from disadvantaged backgrounds are violent sometimes. But she can't have attacked you as violently as you say. Fr Abbot would never have allowed it.&quot;  &quot;She could, and he did.&quot; said Abagail, &quot;Fr Abbot couldn't care what we do, as long as we turn up for chapel every three hours.&quot;  &quot;The thing is&quot;, said Cecilia, &quot;she hasn't apologised. Even when Fr Abbot tried to make her.&quot;  &quot;Then it's all the more important that you forgive her&quot; said Cecilia's father.  &quot;Well maybe. But she still would be one of the ones to miss the boat&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;Miss the boat?&quot; asked Cecilia's father.  &quot;We borrowed a boat, but there was only room for six people in it. So four got left out.&quot; explained Cecilia.  &quot;You borrowed a boat?&quot;  &quot;Well, nicked&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;Adam and Albert cut through the mooring chains with a hacksaw, and we took it for a sail&quot;.  &quot;And no-one saw you?&quot;  &quot;It was at night.&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;At night?&quot; Cecilia's father for the first time looked alarmed, &quot;what did Fr Abbot do?&quot;  &quot;Nothing&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;Or almost nothing&quot; said Abagail, &quot;he sent us to the kitchen, so we nick all the food.&quot;  &quot;I don't know what Fr Abbot is thinking, letting you sail boats at night&quot; said Cecilia's father, &quot;Cecilia, I didn't teach you to sail so that you could go and drown yourself. What would happen if you hit a rock? Don't trust a lifejacket to save you, not in the dark.&quot;  Cecilia prudently didn't tell him that they had sailed without any lifejackets at all.    The second course arrived, which was salmon with peppers and asparagus. There was more bread with it, and little pats of butter.  &quot;This is a real meal&quot; said Adam.  &quot;First decent food in ages&quot; said Abagail, &quot;and we can talk. We're not allowed to at St Tom's&quot;  &quot;Really&quot; said Cecilia's mother.  &quot;We have reading instead&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;Not all the time though&quot; said Adam, &quot;they're a bit lenient on us. It's not as if we are monks. You can talk at breakfast.&quot;  &quot;And your prayers are gloomy.&quot; said Cecilia's mother.  &quot;Oh, that's None,&quot; said Adam, &quot;three O'Clock is the time of the devil's greatest power. So None is always a bit sombre. My favourite is Compline.&quot;  &quot;Compline is nice&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;After it's bed&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;Or trips out of the dorm&quot; said Abagail, giggling.    For the past several weeks Adam had shared a the same dorm as Ibrahim. However just the two of them, with no lights out, was a different experience. The two boys talked long into the night.  &quot;You three think you're superior&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;because you can say prayers in Latin and talk about Compline and Terce. But don't you see that you are not? If everybody could do it, there would be no point. St Tom's would do something else.&quot;  &quot;Like what?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;Like Greek, or sing the Psalms in Hebrew. Anything to make out that we're better than other people. That's all religion is, in my opinion. Hypocrisy.&quot; said Ibrahim.  Adam thought about this. &quot;But surely we are superior, our parents wouldn't be paying good money if we were not. Lot's of people apply and don't get past the exam.&quot;  &quot;Being rich and intelligent doesn't make you better&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;the religion is just a smokescreen. What parents, what monks are interested in is exam results. To get people like Rupert into Oxford University. Religion disguises what they are doing.&quot;  &quot;Why would anyone want to do that?&quot; said Adam, &quot;we could be working all the time we spend at chapel.&quot;  &quot;Because no-one likes to think that they are evil&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;but they are. Everyone is evil. &quot;  &quot;Everyone, like Cecilia's father?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;He just wants friends for Cecilia. And nice exam results. He doesn't actually care about us.&quot; said Ibrahim.  &quot;So what about Cecilia?&quot;   &quot;Stuck up. Just a bit less blatant about it than Sebastian and short Mary. As for blonde Mary, is she for real?&quot; said Ibrahim.  &quot;James?&quot;  &quot;Bully.&quot;  &quot;Albert?&quot;  &quot;Albert's just interested in what he's interested in. Doesn't care about anybody else. He's mates with you because Sebastian and James have no time for him. That's all.&quot;  &quot;Mandy?&quot;  &quot;I like Mandy. And you and Abagail. But you're turning into a religious nut, Adam. Don't let St Tom's do that to you.&quot;  &quot;That's the idea of a monastery. To turn out religious.&quot; said Adam.  &quot;But none of it is true&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot; 'Benedic, domine, nos', 'bless us, Oh Lord'. What's that supposed to mean? The food is rubbish anyway. Who wants to thank God for food you can hardly eat? As if secular people don't get better food than we do. There is no God.&quot;  &quot;How do you know?&quot; asked Adam.  &quot;Because if there was a God we could see Him.&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;but we can't. There are no spirits, or faeries at the bottom of the garden.&quot;  &quot;There are ghosts though&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Don't believe in those, either.&quot;  &quot;I saw one&quot;, said Adam, &quot;a monk.&quot;  &quot;It couldn't have been a ghost&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;just a trick of the light. Or one of the monks, out for a wander.&quot;  &quot;No, it wasn't one of the monks&quot; said Adam.  &quot;Then a trick of the light&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;Adam, do you believe in God because you saw a ghost?&quot;  &quot;No&quot; said Adam, &quot;but I know the idea that there is no supernatural is untrue, because I saw a ghost. However I believed in God before then and I still believe after.&quot;  &quot;Well why can't I see it?&quot; asked Ibrahim, &quot;that tells me that, actually, there are no ghosts. I don't say you're lying Adam, I know you wouldn't do that. But it must have been a trick of the light, or of your mind.&quot;  &quot;Ibrahim&quot;, said Adam, &quot;did you mind not being on the boat?&quot;  &quot;Someone had to be excluded.&quot;  &quot;But it was you. I didn't think at the time, but it was wrong to leave you as the only boy not there. Another could have been squeezed on. Now you're not in the kitchen, either. You're cut out from all our fun.&quot; said Adam.  &quot;I suppose I mind,&quot; said Ibrahim, &quot;to be honest it is rotten, being the only one in the JC.&quot;  &quot;How about&quot; said Adam, &quot;prayer is what we do? To mark the passing of the day. When we eat, after we eat. Before we go to bed. Just what we do as a community.&quot;  &quot;It's a waste of time.&quot;  &quot;Well it teaches you Latin&quot;  &quot;But why do you need Latin? To pray. It's a totally closed loop. We've moved on from that. No-one speaks Latin any more.&quot;  &quot;Except the Church&quot;  &quot;Except the Church&quot;  &quot;But it gives us one language.&quot;  &quot;To make us feel better than other people. Don't you see that that's all there is to St Tom's, Adam? It's a trick to make you feel you're superior to everyone else, so you knuckle down, and get your grades. And get money, so you can send your children to St Tom's too.&quot;  &quot;We've come full circle&quot; said Adam.  &quot;We've come full circle.&quot;  &quot;We've never talked like this, before&quot; said Adam, &quot;somehow it's different, with the others there.&quot;   Eventually they fell asleep, snuggling down into the unaccustomed soft pillows and deep duvets. The room was glowingly warm, as well. In the morning there was bacon and eggs for breakfast, instead of porridge.  Cecilia's father drove them all back to St Tom's in time for Sunday Mass.</p>
        
        <p>Meanwhile Mandy had been taken out by her social worker. They went to the village, and bought fish and chips from a small shack. They went back to the social workers' car, which was a green hatchback, to eat them.  &quot;We never have chips&quot; said Mandy, &quot;just boiled potatoes, or occasionally roast ones.&quot;  &quot;They're trying to give you a balanced, healthy diet&quot; said the social worker, &quot;but chips just once won't harm you.&quot;  Mandy privately thought to herself that boiled potatoes every day was hardly &quot;balanced&quot;, but held her peace.  &quot;I need to know that you are getting on OK at St Tom's&quot; said the social worker.  &quot;Oh, OK, I suppose&quot; said Mandy, a bit sullenly.  &quot;Well do you have friends?&quot; asked the social worker.  &quot;A few&quot;  &quot;So can you tell me who your friends are?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Well there's blonde Mary, and Olivia, and Jade&quot; said Mandy.  &quot;What about the other girls in your year?&quot;  &quot;Blonde Mary is in my year&quot; said Mandy.  &quot;Mandy&quot;, said the social worker, bring out a piece of paper, &quot;I want you to draw a circle, with yourself at the centre. Then put on all your relationships, with the most close nearest in.&quot;  Mandy scribbled a stick character for herself, then added blonde Mary in the centre, Jade and Olivia in the next circle. She thought.  &quot;That's it?&quot; asked the social worker.  &quot;That's it&quot; said Mandy.  &quot;Mandy, it's not a failure if you leave&quot; said the social worker, &quot;if you really are so unhappy here.&quot;  &quot;There's only ten in a class&quot; said Mandy, &quot;and I'm not the worst. In fact I see myself getting better as the weeks go by. I wouldn't have that anywhere other than at St Tom's. If I stick it out here I can leave, go to a good university, get a good job. My life will be set.&quot;  &quot;You can go to an equally good university from a comprehensive.&quot; said the social worker, &quot;I went to a comprehensive and I got an upper second in social studies from Bradford university.&quot;  &quot;No you can't&quot; said Mandy, &quot;not from care, you can't. I'm sticking it out at St Tom's and getting that degree, and no-one, no girl, no monk, not you, not especially that bitch short Mary, is going to tell me that I'm not. I don't care how much they hate me, I don't care even if I hate myself. I will never, ever give up.&quot;  &quot;OK, calm down Mandy, I'm trying to help you.&quot; said the social worker. &quot;Maybe we need to discuss why you feel so tense.&quot;  &quot;Maybe we don't talk about me and my problems. Even I get bored of them sometimes&quot; said Mandy.  They finished the fish and chips. They went into the Tescos and Mandy bought herself a nice pair of trainers, using the money she had got from Jade and Olivia.  &quot;They're only Tescos but they're better than the gym shoes I had to run in&quot; she said.  &quot;Do you do a lot of running, Mandy?&quot; asked the social worker.  &quot;Oh, lots&quot;.  &quot;Do you want me to come back on the ferry with you?&quot; the social worker finally asked, after their time was up.  &quot;That would be nice.&quot;  The ferry made its way back to the island. As she disembarked, Mandy slipped the boatman a few coins. The social worker looked surprised.  &quot;Always tip the boatman&quot; said Mandy.  &quot;See you in the morning&quot; said the social worker.  &quot;In the morning&quot; said Mandy.</p>
        
        <p>There were a few girls from the upper years lounging about wistfully in the Junior Calefactory. These were also ones whose parents, for one reason or another, had not been able to visit them, and unlike Adam and Abagail had not been invited out. Mandy made herself a cup of tea, then reported to Matron for bed.  The dormitory was completely deserted. Mandy went to the toilet cistern and gazed admiringly for a few minutes at the wraps, protected from the water by a plastic bag and then by clingfilm round each one. Only she and blonde Mary knew they were there.  &quot;If I flushed them they'd go straight out to sea&quot; she thought to herself, &quot;no-one will ever know.&quot;  Mandy wrapped her duvet around herself. A great sadness overtook her, and, with no need to hide her emotions, she cried long and bitterly into the pillow. She had been crying for about two hours, working over all the petty insults that the others had inflicted upon her in the Coventry, and then the even worse things that had happened to her before arriving at St Tom's. Finally she was exhausted.  &quot;Mandy&quot; said someone, as though it were a question.  &quot;I like Mandy&quot; said someone else, then said something else that was unintelligible.  &quot;That's the idea of a monastery, to turn out religious.&quot; said the first.  &quot;Adam?&quot; said Mandy, but there was no Adam there. She was fast asleep.</p>
