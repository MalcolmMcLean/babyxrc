        <p>Chapter 15. <B>The white stag,</B></p>
        
        <p>Monday morning the boys rose a hour before the rest of the school for Prime as usual, then they met Br Kieran and the two prefects by the minibus. Albert had his GPS phone handy. The girls arrived five minutes later. They were all dressed in old clothes, not school uniform, with the exception of Br Kieran who still wore his habit.  &quot;Everyone got their lunch, waterproofs?&quot; Br Kieran called out, &quot;bring your mobile phone if you have it, just to be on the safe side. Mary, you cannot walk through the Caledonian forest in those ridiculous shoes. Get proper boots on right away.&quot;  Blonde Mary walked haughtily back to the dorm. Eventually they were all present and correct.  &quot;Breviary?&quot; said Abagail. Adam nodded.  &quot;We need to set up the traps by dawn&quot; said Br Kieran, &quot;to give us maximum time to catch some insects. Particularly because there won't be as many this late into autumn.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The ferry was already docked, and Br Kieran drove the minibus onto it. The children clambered aboard, and the ferryman loosed the mooring, and they were away, over the still dark strait separating the island from the mainland.  &quot;Thanks&quot;, Br Kieran tipped the ferryman, and everyone piled into the minibus,  &quot;I want that seat&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;I was here first&quot; protested blonde Mary, &quot;get your own seat.&quot;  &quot;Two of the boys are going to have to lie on the floor&quot; said Br Kieran, &quot;it's not far.&quot;  After a bit of squabbling Adam and Ibrahim were picked on by the prefects, who were named Mark and Gillian, to surrender their seats. So they lay in the narrow corridor between the banks of seats. Br Kieran drove for about half an hour, then the minibus pulled into a layby.  &quot;I stay here&quot; he said, &quot;two traps each, and separate into two groups of five. On second thoughts, I'll do it for you. Boys and girls. The prefects will show you how to set them up.&quot;  Mark took a map and led the boys into the conifer forest. Gillian took the girls in the other direction.  &quot;Meet you at the Royal Mile&quot; Mark said to Gillian after they had parted from Br Kieran. Abagail smiled.  The traps consisted of two small buckets, with a steel cover that prevented leaves and other detritus from dropping directly into them, but was lifted up an inch or so above the bucket rim to allow the insects to enter. The bucket was filled with half an inch of water, to which was added honey, ethanol, and propene glycol to kill the insects. A pinch of a foul smelling powder called dentonium benzoate was added to deter small animals from drinking the solution.  The buckets were arranged in pairs, about two feet apart, with a steel guide vane between them. An insect, crawling on its way, would reach the guide vane and, unable to cross it, follow it along either to the left or the right. Eventually it would reach a bucket, and drop in.  You had to dig a hole for the bucket, add the ingredients, and then cover it with the metal cover. Then the trap was set up. It didn't take too long. Getting the right location on the map was the trickiest part.  Abagail secreted away some of the ethanol.  &quot;Do they die of drink?&quot; Abagail asked Gillian.  &quot;I think so&quot; said Gillian, &quot;the propene glycol won't do them any good either. It kills them and acts as a preservative.&quot;  &quot;So it's just normal alcohol, like you get in beer?&quot; Abagail persisted.  &quot;It's ethanol, yes, exactly the same as normal alcohol&quot; said Gillian, &quot;But ask Br Kieran. I'm just the prefect.&quot;  Abagail smiled. Gillian couldn't watch all five of them. Even if she was suspicious now, it was too late. The ethanol had been poured a few minutes ago into Abagail's water bottle.    It took about an hour and a half to set up all the traps, by which time the Sun was firmly into the sky. They saw deer, and chaffinches.  &quot;OK, now we start the nature walk&quot; said Gillian, &quot;I want you to note down the species of all the trees that we pass, and take leaf samples of each new one.&quot;  The girls groaned. This was boring. They worked their way slowly through the forest, painstaking noting down trees.</p>
        
        <p> The boys had a better time of it. As Br Kieran had said, all the trees in the coniferous forest were of the same species anyway. Mark had a guidebook, and contented himself with identifying small shrubs and plants they found on the forest floor.  &quot;Those mushrooms&quot; he flipped through the guidebook, &quot;anyone any idea what those are?&quot;  &quot;It's either Coprinus comatus or Phallus impudicus&quot; said James, &quot;doesn't look much like a phallus to me.&quot;  &quot;We'll go for Coprinus comatus then&quot;, said Mark, &quot;shaggy inkcap&quot;.  &quot;This one is green elf-cup&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;I've seen it before.&quot; Indeed it had stained a fallen branch green.  They gradually made their way to the Royal Mile pub. A blue plaque said that it had been founded in 1203, as a post for Royal soldiers who protected the King of Scotland's hunting rights in the forest. The &quot;Mile&quot; wasn't a mile at all, but a corruption of the Latin miles, for soldier.  &quot;This would be where they stayed and rested after duty&quot; said Mark, &quot;and the King stayed here too. Now you lot are too young to drink. So just stay quiet whilst Gillian and I enjoy a quick pint.&quot;  Gillian and the girls arrived a couple of minutes later. They had obviously synchronised their watches.  &quot;Two pints&quot; said Mark.  The children got their lunch boxes out. The proprietor didn't seem to mind. Abagail opened her water bottle, now full of pure ethanol.  &quot;Distract them&quot; she whispered to Cecilia. &#96; &quot;There's a golden eagle&quot; said Cecilia, and ran to the window. She dug Sebastian in the ribs. &quot;See it?&quot;  &quot;Oh indeed I do&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;there's a golden eagle, circling low.&quot;  Albert was on his feet, straining to see it.  &quot;I can't see it&quot; he said.  &quot;It's gone from sight&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;no, there it is, see it Albert.&quot;  Soon everyone except Abagail was clamouring around the tiny window.  &quot;Maybe we'll get a better view if we go outside&quot; said Cecilia, and went to the door. Somewhat wearily, Mark and Gillian went to follow the first years. Seizing her chance, Abagail tipped out some of their beers onto the floor, and filled up the quantity with ethanol. Then she went to the door with the rest.  &quot;It was so low&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;surely it will come round again.&quot;  Eventually they gave up.   &quot;Well never mind&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;well get another chance to see it.&quot;  &quot;Time to pray&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;What?&quot; said Mark.  &quot;Abagail is right&quot; said Adam, &quot;it's noon.&quot; He dived into his satchel for the breviary.  &quot;You can't possibly sing Sexte in a pub&quot; said Mark, &quot;beside, we're away from the monastery.&quot;  &quot;OK&quot; said Adam, &quot;we'll do it outside. Anybody coming?&quot;  One by one all the children filed out. Sebastian took the position of cantor, and sang with a pure, clear note.  &quot;Oh God come to our aid&quot;  &quot;Oh Lord make haste to help us&quot;</p>
        
        <p> Sebastian give the reading</p>
        
        <p> &quot;And the Lord said to Moses, &ldquo;Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes and be ready by the third day, because on that day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. Put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them, &lsquo;Be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it. Whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death. He shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; not a hand is to be laid on him. Whether man or animal, he shall not be permitted to live.&rsquo; Only when the ram&rsquo;s horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>After Moses had gone down the mountain to the people, he consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. Then he said to the people, &ldquo;Prepare yourselves for the third day.  On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast. Everyone in the camp trembled. Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire. The smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace, the whole mountain trembled violently, and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder. Then Moses spoke and the voice of God answered him.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Some rum kids you've got there&quot; said the barman, &quot;another pint?&quot;  &quot;OK, just one&quot; said Mark.  &quot;Scarper&quot; said Abagail, and everybody ran, not waiting for the concluding Psalm.</p>
        
        <p>Within a few minutes, tired, they were well clear of the Royal Mile.  &quot;Poor prefects&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;They'll have to admit that they were in a pub, and they left us to pray the office on our own before they lost us&quot; said Abagail, &quot;and the best thing is, I managed to spike their drinks. So they'll be totally out of it.&quot;  &quot;How do you know it wasn't meths?&quot; asked Cecilia, concerned.  &quot;I asked, silly.&quot; said Abagial, &quot;It's pure ethanol. You know, the same stuff that is in beer and whiskey.&quot;  &quot;GPS time&quot; said Albert. Within a couple of minute's he'd located a route to where he had hidden the bows and arrows.  &quot;You've ruined my cello case&quot; said short Mary.  &quot;Never mind&quot; said James, &quot;It's only there to protect the cello. Our bows and arrows are dry, and here's my knife. Stick the arrows into your satchels, like a quiver.&quot;  Then they took off their outer garments and rolled them in the mud. Then James and Adam streaked mud onto everybody's face.  &quot;Come on Mary,&quot; James said to blonde Mary, &quot;you don't want the deer to take fright at you.&quot; he streaked mud into her face, and she suddenly looked more glamorous, like a film star.  &quot;OK, now, after a deer. And don't let anyone see you.&quot;  Bows in hands, they strode back into the forest. The walked for maybe a mile on narrow tracks until they saw a group of five deer in a clearing, browsing contentedly on the leaves. Two were does, one was a big stag, and there were two first year stags with new antlers. One of the young stags was a light colour.   Abagail's order was immediate.  &quot;Get that white stag&quot;.  Cautiously, they approached, notching arrows to their bows. Blonde Mary, Mandy, and short Mary, who had refused to take part in the archery, brought up the rear. James drew his bow to full weight, and shot an arrow deliberately and accurately at the white stag. It hit it in the side, and the barbs Albert had provided it with meant that it stuck in. All five deer instantly ran away into the forest.  &quot;James, you idiot&quot; Sebastian said, &quot;Now we've got to follow that wounded animal up. We've got an awful job. Why couldn't you have waited?&quot;  &quot;Sorry&quot; said James, &quot;at least I got it.&quot;  &quot;We're going to have to search the forest&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;otherwise it will die slowly and horribly. We must find that white stag.&quot;  They went in the direction in which it had disappeared, but there was nothing to be seen, not even a trail of blood.  &quot;We need a dog&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;This is hopeless&quot; said Adam, &quot;we can't outrun a deer&quot;  &quot;Well we've got to try&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;it's not going to go far with an arrow in its side.&quot;    They tried for a few more minutes, but Adam was right, it was hopeless. Then Mandy screamed. A snake had slithered out of the underground, and menaced her leg. She froze, rooted to the spot in sheer terror. The eyes and tongue of the snake moved, very much alive, as it pondered what to do with her.  Adam dived in and picked it up. It was warm to the touch, not slimy at all. Its coils slipped around his arms. He stroked it.  &quot;Adam, what are you doing?&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;Put that down. It's an adder.&quot;  Adam put the snake down gently.  Cecilia shook her head. &quot;Come on, let's get out of its way&quot; she said. They went another few hundred yards along the path, until they came to a small, fenced field. A horse was grazing in the middle of it, and jumps were set up for it to practise jumping over. There seemed to be nobody about.  Sebastian and Cecilia looked at each other.  &quot;Does anyone have a mint?&quot; asked Cecilia.  Adam rooted in his pocket and took out an old packet. Cecilia went up to the horse and offered it the mint. &quot;Now I've made friends with you&quot; she said, stoking it's muzzle, &quot;I'm going to have to borrow you. All in a good cause.&quot;  &quot;Go girl&quot; said James and Sebastian, and lifted her onto its back.  The horse was a magnificent animal, obviously used from show jumping in some of the top competitions. Cecilia had ridden Trumpert bareback before, but only round the yard. Now she had to do it in earnest.  &quot;Give me the rope&quot; she said.  The boys cut it and she made a crude bridle. It wasn't much, but it was just enough to give some control of the horse's direction.  &quot;Now go like the wind&quot; said Cecilia, and slapped him.  The horse went off at a brisk canter. Cecilia had the ride of her life. She had never ridden so expensive, so able an animal. The horse for his part had the ride of his life also. Never before had he had so small and light a rider as Cecilia on his back, and without a saddle either. It was like running free. They cantered through the forest, then broke into a full gallop for the broader paths. With the horse under her like a pair of wings, Cecilia could cover a lot of ground. Eventually she spotted the white stag, the arrow still sticking from his side, still with the other four deer. She turned the horse round, and went to inform the others.  By the time they got there the group of deer had moved on, but by now Cecilia had less forest to search. it took her only a few minutes to find them again. She brought the horse to a slow walk by the others.  The children fanned out, bows in hands, approaching cautiously so as not to startle their quarry, determined this time not to break discipline. Six arrows - Cecilia was still on the horse - were notched into bows, and drawn back. James nodded.  At the same instant all six were loosed. Adam and Abagail missed. Ibrahim hit but bounced off. James, Sebastian,and Albert&rsquo;s went full in, and the white stag sprang into the air. The other deer fled. It was left alone in the centre of the circle, and the children reloaded. They shot again, and this time every single arrow hit.  &quot;Grab it&quot; said James, &quot;disable its legs, or it will give us a nasty kick&quot;  Two children went for each limb, with James at the head. The stag was still alive, but obviously fatally wounded. James got out his knife and looked at Adam.  &quot;Lord look with favour on this sacrifice&quot; said Adam, &quot;as once you accepted the gifts of your servant Abel, the sacrifice of Abraham, our father in faith, and the bread and wine offered by your priest, Melchizedek&quot;  &quot;May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands&quot; said Abagail, &quot;for the praise and glory of His name, For our good and the good of all His Church.&quot;  &quot;Do it, James&quot; said Adam.  James closed his eyes, and drew the knife across the stag's throat. Blood spurted out, and it surrendered its life.  Adam and James butchered the carcass, cutting off the fat thighs. There was fat round the thighs which they cut off also, and wrapped round them. By this time Sebastian and Albert had got a fire ready, on a platform they built out of stones. Adam put the thighs with the covering of fat on the fire, and they caught light, giving a sickly sweet aroma. Blue smoke ascended upwards. James cut another few joints.  &quot;This is Mandy's first kill&quot; said Cecilia.  Adam and James took some of the blood, and daubed it on Mandy's face. It mingled with the mud and washed some of it off. It was a solemn moment.  &quot;You are now one of us&quot; said Abagail.  Tears stung at Mandy's eyes, but they were tears of pleasure.    A group of six young men and women in leather jackets appeared from the undergrowth.  &quot;Having a barbie?&quot; asked the leader, a young woman in a fringed leather jacket, a short skirt, and glass beads threaded all over her shirt, which was loose and of a heavy cotton material.  &quot;Sure, join us&quot; said James, in reality unsure about these people.  Two young men had guitars, and another had a small drum. They set these up.  &quot;There's plenty of meat&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;the first portion should be ready now.&quot; He gave it to Abagail, who filled her mouth with solid venison. It tasted good.  The second bit, as seemed only fitting, he offered to the young woman who seemed to be the leader. She nodded slightly as she took it.   &quot;We've got booze&quot; said another young woman, and drew a box of wine from her satchel. The children all had drinking bottles or cups, and she filled each one in turn, starting with Abagail.  &quot;Cheers&quot; said everyone.  &quot;We've got some bread rolls too. Help soak up all that meat.&quot; And they took some burger buns out of their satchels. By now everyone had a portion of meat in his hand.  &quot;What are you kids doing here, anyway?&quot; asked the leader.  &quot;Collecting insects&quot; said Abagail.  Abagail took out her mobile phone and took a photo of the dead stag and the fire. She turned it on one of the men with guitars.  &quot;No photos&quot; he said, and pushed the phone gently away.   They started a song. Everyone was experienced in singing after nearly a term at St Tom's, and they soon picked up the tune. It was a haunting melody, unlike anything anyone had ever heard before.  Adam felt the wine going to his head. Someone started a dance going, and it was impossible not to join in. The three men played the guitars and the drum and the rest danced in a circle round the fire, which was now reduced to hot embers.  &quot;You're a rock band, aren't you?&quot; Adam was wildly guessing. The leader woman just smiled at him.  &quot;Move your feet, one, two, one, two&quot; she led him in the dance. His accustomed clumsiness fell all away, and he was happy and part of the pulsating circle of dancers. The musicians changed tune again, and they danced in the opposite direction. All was lightness and laughter.  &quot;Which of these girls do you like best?&quot; the woman asked Adam.  &quot;Abbey&quot; said Adam.  &quot;You can't dance with Abbey&quot; she laughed, &quot;who else.&quot;  &quot;So hard to tell.&quot;  &quot;You must choose.&quot;  &quot;Cecilia.&quot;  Cecilia flushed with pleasure. The leader paired them and they danced in the centre of the circle, their faces reddening in the hot fire.  Then the musicians lay down their instruments, and the children collapsed, exhausted, on the soft grass. The leader handed round some more wine. There was some talk, but Adam was too tired to follow it. Imperceptibly, he fell asleep.    When they woke the rock band were gone. There was also no trace of the white stag, though the ashes of the fire were still warm. Also their bows and arrows had disappeared. The horse was gone as well.  &quot;Don't worry, I expect he'll find his own way back home&quot; said Cecilia.  &quot;We'd better get back&quot; said Albert, &quot;Br Kieran will be out looking for us&quot;.  They used Albert' GPS to find the Royal Mile. Mark and Gillian were still there, looking the worse for drink, but trying to hide it.  &quot;Where on Earth have you been?&quot; demanded Mark, &quot;It's time to go back to the traps already.&quot;  &quot;I could have sworn we spent several hours&quot; said Cecilia, quietly, &quot;plus time asleep.&quot;  &quot;Well don't worry about it&quot; said Abagail, &quot;don't get us into trouble.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>They split up again to collect the traps, which had a reasonable collection of insects in them, mainly different types of beetle. These were all labelled and transferred, with some of the preserving fluid, to plastic beakers for identification in the lab.  &quot;Nice time kids?&quot; said Br Kieran, who was in the minibus, reading a newspaper by the light of the passenger lamp, for it was now dusk.  &quot;Oh yes&quot; said Abagail. They were soon back at St Toms, and fast asleep.</p>
        
        <p> The next day Abagail was checking the local paper on the Internet. She pulled up a story.  &quot;Rare white stag killed by poachers. A rare white stag, said to be worth over three hundred thousand pounds, was today reported missing, assumed brutally killed by poachers. The animal, which was one of only two in the world, had a genetic condition called leucism, which caused pigment in his skin to degenerate. Landowner Mr Baines, who owns the animal, was going to auction the right to hunt him to the highest bidder. Bids had already been accepted from as far away as Japan. Police are investigating.&quot;  &quot;Oh crumbs&quot;, said Abagail. There was only one thing to do, and she got a USB connector to her mobile phone.  &quot;Gillian&quot; said Abagail and Cecilia, sweetly, &quot;we'll do your room out as a thank you for taking us on the trip yesterday.&quot;  Prefects had shared study bedrooms that were a bit bigger and nicer than everybody else's. They had their own washbasins and a place they could put down a sandwich or a cup of coffee, though like everyone else they were forbidden from cooking in bedrooms and had to use the prefect's kitchen. They could also have their own music and computers. There was quite a bit to tidy.  That evening Abagail, on Albert's advice, took video clip after video clip, filling the memory of her phone several times over.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;This is gross&quot; complained blonde Mary, &quot;even worse than the mice. All these dead beetles, and we're supposed to identify them.&quot;  &quot;Shut up Mary&quot; said Br Kieran, and handed her the identification guide. &quot;Use a magnifying glass if you have to.&quot;  &quot;Mainly woodlice in mine&quot; said Albert, &quot;they're not beetles at all. I think the situation is clear, the conifer forest is less diverse.&quot;  &quot;You certainly have fewer insects in your traps&quot; said Br Kieran, &quot;but maybe that means that the girls are better at setting them. You need to calculate the Shannon index.&quot;  They did. Eventually, after a whole day's field trip with the entire class, and another good two hours' work in the lab, they were left with two numbers. 1.56 for the broadleaf forest, and 1.03 for the conifers.  &quot;That's it&quot; said Br Kieran, &quot;there's our result.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>&ldquo;I need some defence&rdquo; complained Albert, pulling the ball for the third time from the bushes behind the two jerseys. The second years were beating them as usual.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got Sebastian, and Adam&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;how can we give you any more?  &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we play 3 - 1?&rdquo; asked Albert.  &ldquo;Some do&rdquo; said Sebastian, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of it.&rdquo;  &ldquo;OK, Ibrahim also back.&rdquo;  &ldquo;No, not Ibrahim. He&rsquo;s useless.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Who else is there?&rdquo; asked James. The obvious answer struck him.  &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m back I won&rsquo;t score any goals.&rdquo;  &ldquo;But they won&rsquo;t score any either.&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the difference that counts, not how many goals you score personally.&rdquo;  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easier to defend than attack.&rdquo; said Sebastian.  &ldquo;Which is why the best player is always the forward.&rdquo; said James.  &ldquo;But we didn&rsquo;t score any goals anyway against St Dunstan&rsquo;s&rdquo; said Sebastian. &ldquo;So what does it matter. Go for nil-nil&rdquo;.  &ldquo;You always get some chances&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;always.&rdquo;  James shook his head. They continued playing, and the second years scored a fourth goal. James suddenly realised what he must do, and played back.   The St Dunstan's team arrived two days later for the big match. It was held inside, in the gym. Since it was only a first year event there was no compulsion on the whole school to attend, but the girls were there on the balcony, watching, and also the second years with whom they played at lunchtimes. Andrew, who was captain of games, was there in his professional capacity and there were a few higher years who had nothing better to do. They had a pep talk from Br Gwilliam.  &quot;You can win this match&quot; he said, &quot;just play as a team, and show some attacking spirit. You've got your support behind you&quot;.  &quot;Everyone back except Ibrahim&quot; said James, &quot;just kill that game. Let nothing get through to Albert.&quot;  St Dunstan's won the toss and kicked off. They instantly went forward. Sebastian intercepted, and passed to James, who kicked it up to Ibrahim. None of the St Tom's boys went forwards. Ibrahim was swiftly dispossessed by the St Dunstan's defender, and the ball came back onto the attack. James and Sebastian squabbled with the St Dunstan's boys over it in midfield, and then eventually passed it back to Albert, who kicked it out to Adam. Adam tried a pass up to Ibrahim but it went wide.  St Dunstan's had a shot on goal, but Albert saved it. It went back up to Ibrahim, and was swiftly lost. At this stage, the St Dunstan's boys began to get over confident, leaving Ibrahim unmarked. Sebastian won the ball, and made a long pass to Ibrahim. Ibrahim was clear in front of the St Dunstan's goal, and made a shot. It hit the post. The St Dunstan's goalkeeper called out, as if to say &quot;where is my defence?&quot;  After that St Dunstan's learnt their lesson, and were more cautious. As James had said, St Tom's killed the game. Time after time it the ball was won, and instead of building an attack, it was passed back to Albert, or passed up to Ibrahim. Only rarely, when a really good chance presented itself, did James or Sebastian risk going forwards in support. It wasted a lot of time. The spectators were cheering less loudly, looking bored.  Eventually St Dunstan's did break through James and Sebastian, and then pushed easily past Adam. It should have been a save for Albert, but he mishandled it, and put the ball into his own net. One nil to St Dunstans.  The ball was in play for a few minutes more, and it was the second half.  &quot;That's respectable&quot; said James.  &quot;We just need lady luck&quot; said Sebastian.</p>
        
        <p>They kept the same tactics going in the second half. The St Dunstan's boys were getting frustrated, because they were outnumbered four to two, in the St Tom's half. Their superior play couldn't defeat those odds. Yet they daredn't bring the other two forwards, because Ibrahim was always lurking, always getting balls passed to him and losing them again.  Sebastian saw a hole and a good chance, and rushed through it, delivering a powerful shot on target. The St Dunstan's goalkeeper just saved it, and there was a cheer. It bounced off, and to Ibrahim, who promptly put it into the back of the St Dunstan's net. There was a great cheer from the girls.  St Dunstan's came back onto the attack, but couldn't penetrate the web of St Tom's defence. Eventually James and a St Dunstan's forward went for the same ball, collided, and went down in a heap. The St Dunstan's boy tried to get up, then fell back down again, clutching his calf. Br Gwilliam and the St Dunstan's teacher, Mr Warren, went onto the field.  &quot;It's a ham-string&quot; said Mr Warren, &quot;he'll have to come off.&quot;  &quot;In which case we lose one member&quot; said Br Gwilliam, &quot;James, who do you want to retire?&quot;  &quot;Ibrahim&quot; said James, instantly.  Br Gwilliam looked at him curiously. &quot;Have you really looked at your team?&quot; he said.  &quot;Yes&quot; said James, &quot;Ibrahim goes off.&quot;  &quot;Well, it's your decision&quot; Br Gwilliam shrugged.  Ibrahim went off to applause.</p>
        
        <p> By now the game was looser. However St Dunstan's had lost their best player. James and Sebastian were winning against the other three. There were more chances, and the game became more exciting. Albert pulled off some spectacular saves, and the teams were still level.  Albert distributed the ball out to Adam. He passed to James, who beat one of the St Dunstan's boys. He was in a clear space, and looked for Sebastian. Sebastian was being marked by the other two. The only possibility was Adam. The St Dunstan's goalkeeper thought James was planning a shot and came out to close him down. James passed to Adam. Adam controlled it. There was just a foot or so of space between the goal and the keeper. Adam closed his eyes and struck it. Oh joy! The ball sailed through the space, behind the goalkeeper and into the net. A few minutes later the final whistle blew. 2-1 to St Tom's.  &quot;It's the first we've ever won!&quot; James was jubilant, &quot;I knew Ibrahim was getting exhausted. My decision was right. But well done Ibrahim too, for getting our first.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> St Tom's laid on a decent supper for the players. The St Dunstan's boys got a cell next to them in the monastery.  &quot;It's kind of creepy in here&quot; said one of the St Dunstan's boys, as they got ready for bed.  &quot;We're used to it&quot; said Adam, &quot;but I suppose it is. All those monks and statues and old graves.&quot;   A parcel arrived for Albert on the ferry, and turned out to be the bows and arrows. It didn't have any address of a sender, and there was no letter with it.  &quot;We can go on another deer hunt&quot; he told Abagail.  &quot;No we can't&quot; said Abagail, &quot;the police are coming. Just play dumb.&quot;  As Abagail had predicted, the police arrived a day later, with no lesser man than the superintendent in charge. anxious to interview everybody about the day's events in the forest. At Abagail's instructions, everyone just said they had been together, played in the woodlands, and seen nothing suspicious.  Meanwhile Mark and Gillian weren't honest about being drunk when they should have been looking after the first years, and suspicions were aroused. The police searched their possessions, taking away some of them for analaysis.  They returned a day later, and tackled Gillian on why a picture of a dead white stag had been found on her phone.  &quot;I told you I'd get revenge on the prefects&quot; said Abagail.  &quot;Abbey&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;that wasn't called for. Gillian is nice.&quot;  &quot;She's a prefect and that's what counts&quot; said Abagail, &quot;now she'll have all sorts of awkward questions to answer.&quot;  Meanwhile the police also called in Jade. Apparently someone somewhere had accused her of dealing in cannabis. Sure enough, a substantial amount, too much for merely personal use, was found amongst her possessions. Fr Abbot was forced to suspend her pending the outcome of the trial. &ldquo;We have zero tolerance to drugs&rdquo; said the superintendent solemnly, addressing the whole school in the refectory.   Fr Abbot saw the back of the police that week. His school could finally get back to normal, or so he thought.</p>
