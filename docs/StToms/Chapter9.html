        <p>Chapter 9. <B>The Marys fall out</B></p>
        
        <p> Short Mary had had a terrible trip out, with her parents constantly squabbling. She needed to decide whether to stay at St Tom's, and it just wasn't the right environment in which to make that decision.<BR>
        &quot;I can't say the other girls are up to much&quot; she told her parents, &quot;and doubtless I'd find a friendlier bunch somewhere else. But Abbey and Cecilia are OK with me. Abbey's father is only a computer programmer, but her mother has money, and she's a nice person. Cecilia's spolit and goes on terribly about that horse of hers, as though people who can't ride are inferior. But I wouldn't say she's bad.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Brother Dominic felt you needed more time to settle in&quot; said her father.<BR>
        &quot;But Br Dominic would say that&quot; said her mother, &quot;he admitted as much himself. It's what we want, not what Br Dominic wants, that counts.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;It would seem such a failure to be the only one to leave, at half term&quot; said short Mary, &quot;in fact I can't believe we're having this discussion. I should be having fun.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;It won't matter what the others think, once you leave&quot; said her father.<BR>
        &quot;Oh, don't say that&quot; said the mother, &quot;it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Of course it matters what other people think of you. But if St Tom's isn't right, get that over sooner rather than later. Come, I'll take you back home right now, if you prefer.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I need more time to decide.&quot; said short Mary.<BR>
        &quot;By then it might be too late&quot; said her mother. This gave rise to another furious squabble, with her father saying that she could leave any time.<BR>
        &quot;I can last out a term&quot; said short Mary.<BR>
        It was on this note that they returned to the island, some time after Matins.</p>
        
        <p>Abagail and Cecilia were already there.<BR>
        &quot;Abbey&quot; said short Mary, &quot;can you do a trick on blonde Mary's mother? She was so awful to my poor dear Mummy.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;What sort of trick?&quot; asked Abagail.<BR>
        &quot;I don't know&quot; said short Mary, &quot;think of one.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;The thing is&quot; said Abagail, &quot;I rather like her.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;O come on Abbey&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;don't be so easily fooled. I'm surprised you don't see right through her. She needs taking down a peg or two, for flashing her money around in such a vulgar manner. Play a trick.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;She was so horrible and rude to my mother&quot; said short Mary, &quot;she told me all about it. Refusing to queue because she was too grand.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;OK, I'll think about it&quot; said Abagail, &quot;as long as you take the rap for it if it all goes horribly wrong.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I promise&quot; said short Mary.</p>
        
        <p>Abagail thought for a while. The first years were serving the big formal lunch. Abagail wasn't sure whether this was a tradition or part of their punishment for the adventure on the boat. She went into the kitchen and saw the venison pastries laid out, set for each table. There were also copious bottles of wine. She smiled to herself. This would be almost too easy.</p>
        
        <p>Sebastian, Albert and James all arrived, parents in tow, on the same boat. Sebastian and James were in the choir so had to endure Br Bernard's last minute rehearsal. However the monk seemed far more satisfied than either had expected.<BR>
        &quot;Just sing like that&quot; he said, &quot;and we'll be fine.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Blonde Mary was the last to arrive. They had driven all the way to Edinburgh where they had stayed in the best hotel, and bought expensive things for blonde Mary; perfume, and make up, and a new fountain pen embossed with gold. She wasn't allowed computer games or other electronic entertainment, except for a personal music player which she already had, but she had a new memory card for the player.<BR>
        Abagail felt a little bit bad about what she was going to do. Then blonde Mary's mother kissed Sebastian's father, her lips lingering just a little too long on his cheek.<BR>
        &quot;Maybe Cecilia's right&quot; she thought, &quot;poor Mary.&quot;<BR>
        Blonde Mary was annoyed because her mother had not even countenanced moving her from St Tom's. She thought that when her mother complained about Fr Abbot not letting her use the helicopter she was in with a chance, and would realise what a terrible oppressive place the school was. But not a bit of it. If anything, she seemed to rather admire Fr Abbot for his decision.<BR>
        &quot;St Tom's is the best place for you, darling&quot;, she said, in a determined way.<BR>
        &quot;But Mum,&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;can't I stay with you?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;You know that moving about all the time isn't good for you.&quot; said her mother.<BR>
        &quot;But Mum, I could stay at New York while you're in London and California. The butler can look after me.&quot; protested blonde Mary.<BR>
        &quot;Absolutely not&quot; said her mother, &quot;you're going back to St Tom's darling. But don't worry, Mummy will be overjoyed to see you at Christmas, and we can go to New York or California, whichever you want.&quot;<BR>
        Blonde Mary had the sense to put her cheerful face on as the boat neared the monastery jetty, and none of the other girls had any idea what had passed between her and her mother.<BR>
        &quot;Lovely to see you&quot; said blonde Mary to Cecilia and Abagail, &quot;just one day away from the dorm and I'm missing you already. Where is Mandy?&quot; she hugged Mandy as she ran up to her.<BR>
        &quot;I really missed you, Mary&quot; said Mandy, truthfully.<BR>
        Sebastian's father had finished making arrangements to meet blonde Mary's mother in London, and it was time to assemble in the chapel for Mass.<BR>
        The monks and children celebrated high Mass with a dignity and style seen nowhere else in the Church, or in the world for that matter. Weeks and weeks of hard work by Br Bernard had gone into the music, and the childrens' tone, assisted by the superb acoustics of the chapel, was perfect. Fr Abbot, dressed in golden vestments, for that day was the feast of All Saints, led the congregation in prayer, facing the image of Jesus crucified above the altar.  Incense swirled to heaven as the choir sang Kyrie Eleision, and the congregation sang the responses.<BR>
        &quot;Kyrie-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-Eleison&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Kyrie-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-leison&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Christe-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-leison&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The readings were all in Latin, which the older years could follow, but not the first years, nor the vast majority of the parents. However there was a translation in the specially printed books. Fr Abbot then gave his homily. Adam had been expecting some sort of eulogy about the school, but in fact Fr Abbot talked about saints.<BR>
        &quot;The word 'saint' means 'holy'&quot;, he said, &quot;what does 'holy' mean? Well, it is one of those words which is very difficult to define in terms of other words. In the Old Testament, it meant something set apart for the use of God. So this island, dedicated to the service of God, you could say is 'Holy'. This chapel in which we having Mass, you could say is 'holy'. The monks, you could say, are 'holy men'. But that doesn't mean that all of the monks are saints. (laughter)<BR>
        To find out what a saint is, we need to look at the English meaning of the word 'holy'. It just means 'whole'. That is is, healthy, complete. A saint is someone who is healthy. Not physically healthy, of course, though it is easier to be a saint if you have no serious health problems, not even mentally healthy, though here it is maybe more obvious that bad mental health leads to spiritual problems. A saint is someone who is spiritually healthy.<BR>
        So what do we mean by spiritual health? That is the mystery, is it not? Is the man who is always at Mass spiritually healthy, or is he just obsessed with religion? What about the man who is tortured with guilt over something he has done is his past? is he more or less healthy than the man who has done the same thing, yet is not bothered by it? It is easy to say 'spiritual health', much harder to actually achieve it. There are lots of fake cures, crackpot methods like aromatherapy on the market, saying that if you just rub these smelling oils into your body, you will achieve physical health. There are also lots of fake cures on the market, saying, 'take these and you will achieve spiritual health'.<BR>
        The interesting thing is that the fake physical cures, and the fake spiritual cures, are usually one and the same thing. These acupuncture needles 'rebalance spiritual energies'. Or this special diet 'stimulates the holistic mechanisms of the body to heal itself, and puts the mind into harmony with the rhythms of nature, so that it can achieve mastery of the psycho-physical self' .<BR>
        What seem at first sight like medical claims turn out to be moral claims. This is false spirituality.  Real spirituality is always based on love. Which includes love of the self, but only in the most basic, most childish form of spirituality. The saint loves other people, but he does something else, which is even more difficult. He accepts love. It is more blessed to give than to receive, because giving gives one a sense of superiority. It is just as saintly to receive as to give. Love is fertile. You know it is real love when it is producing things of value; real friendships, real activities, real works of art. Ambition on the other hand is sterile.<BR>
        The desire to be saint can never be selfish. Of course we want to be happy, to be physically healthy, to be thought of as good people. But in Christianity a saint 'shows heroic virtue in the face of the hostility of the world'. Sanctity will make you enemies. It will not put you in harmony with humanity, because humanity is fallen. But that doesn't mean that the saint will often have to go without any friends. Normally there are other people we can rely upon. We journey as a community, not alone.&quot;<BR>
        The homily went on a bit longer, and Adam began to get bored. Then it was time to sing the creed, and communion. Finally it was the last hymn, and Fr Abbot, followed by the altar servers, the monks, and the choir, processed out of the chapel.<BR>
        &quot;Absolutely beautiful service&quot; said Albert's mother, &quot;beautiful singing, and incense too.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Abagail, together with the other first years, went to the kitchen.<BR>
        &quot;Start with wine&quot; instructed brother Damian, &quot;white for the starter, red for the venison. However if they want red to start with, let them have it.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Don't worry&quot;, said Albert, &quot;we get to eat later.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Tables were arranged by years, with parents seated separately and also arranged by years, though a few were out of place because they had more than one child at the school.<BR>
        &quot;Aromatherapy is so last season&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;I don't know anyone who ever does it any more. If you want to be healthy, rubbing oils onto your body isn't going to help any. No two ways about it, the only way to get good health is through diet.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;We find ourselves eating less red meat&quot; said Sebastian's father, &quot;more fish and chicken. More pulses and organic vegetables, and fewer fried things.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;A lot of people feel that way&quot; said short Mary's father, &quot;although I'm afraid we doctors tend to smoke and drink and eat unhealthily.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I'm on the macrobiotic diet&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;tropical foods like pineapple and oranges are fine for people who come from the countries where they are grown, but not for Westerners. So I have blackcurrant instead of orange juice, and muesli without coconut, or ground nut oil, obviously, and only herbal tea.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Oh, I only look at genuine medical evidence&quot; said short Mary's mother, poking her ex-husband.<BR>
        &quot;In film you don't just have to be healthy&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, airily, &quot;you have to be better than well. It's not sufficient to be free of illness, as it is in most professions, you have to eat your way to health. And exercise. That's what you find in Hollywood. People will only go to the healthiest restaurants, like Jasper's.&quot;<BR>
        Short Mary's mother looked blankly.<BR>
        &quot;It's in town, dearest&quot; said blonde Mary's mother.<BR>
        &quot;Jasper's is good&quot; said Sebastian's father, &quot;it's just round the corner from my club, in fact. We repair there when we have mixed company.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Completely vegan&quot;, said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;they even torch the kitchen utensils so there are no traces of any animal product. And you can have macrobiotic or supervegan.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Supervegan?&quot; asked short Mary's father.<BR>
        &quot;Without pesticides. They are so cruel to insects, and the birds that feed on them. And those residues build up, poisoning your body.&quot; said blonde Mary's mother.<BR>
        &quot;But not for Mary&quot; said short Mary's father.<BR>
        &quot;Not for Mary&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;goodness, at her little age, needing to worry about pesticides and residues and things. School meals will be fine for her. She complains, but I tell her if they had more fried foods - the things she likes - it wouldn't be as healthy&quot;.<BR>
        &quot;When are you next in town?&quot; asked Sebastian's father.<BR>
        &quot;For the premier of 'Two Loves and a Rose'&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;it's soppy, but it's what the public like. So when Amanda Mirabel offered me two 'A'-list tickets, of course I said, 'Amanda, what are you doing to yourself, appearing in this guff?', but she wasn't offended, she needs the money just as much as I do, and romance pays. It's cheap to produce as well, so we're talking major returns here, like three hundred percent on an outlay of ten million?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;That's better than we get from the farm&quot; said Sebastian's father, &quot;in fact you'd have to go to some dodgy offshore emerging markets' fund for that.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;That's showbiz&quot; said blonde Mary's mother, &quot;but it seems to be my lucky day. Because you are just so convenient, Mr Howard.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;And Jaspers after&quot; said Sebastian's father.<BR>
        &quot;And Jasper's after. Where else could I eat?&quot;</p>
        
        <p> Short Mary's mother scowled, and Sebastian's mother was busy talking to Cecilia's father. Ibrahim and Cecilia served the food.<BR>
        &quot;Some vegetables with this, Ma'am?&quot; asked Ibrahim.<BR>
        &quot;That would be lovely but no thanks&quot;.<BR>
        As Abagail had correctly guessed, blonde Mary's mother was a strict vegetarian. So strict, that in fact she could not eat out of the common vegetable dish. However she had had a pastry specially prepared, with a tomato and mushroom sauce in it with slices of something that looked like bean curd.&quot;<BR>
        The parents began their main dish. Two or three minutes after they had started eating, there was an ear-piercing shriek.<BR>
        &quot;That was meat. Oh my God, oh my God!&quot; blonde Mary's mother was in panic mode.  Short Mary's father patted her on the back.<BR>
        &quot;Just choke it out.&quot;<BR>
        Blonde Mary's mother took a napkin, and disgorged the contents of her mouth into it. She had turned a deathly shade of white.<BR>
        &quot;Induce vomiting&quot; said Albert's father, &quot;you're a doctor.&quot;<BR>
        Short Mary's father ran with her to the washroom. Ten minutes later he reappeared, looking apologetic.<BR>
        &quot;She's just lying down to get over it&quot; he told the other parents, &quot;I've had to administer a mild sedative. However she'll be alright.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;What a terrible thing to happen&quot; said James' mother.</p>
        
        <p>Abagail, Cecilia, and short Mary could hardly suppress themselves from laughing.<BR>
        &quot;She really went to make herself sick&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;how spoilt is that?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Much better than we could have hoped&quot; said Abagail.<BR>
        &quot;Thanks girls,&quot; said short Mary, &quot;that'll teach her for insulting my mother.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>Blonde Mary, meanwhile, was mortified. It soon went round the grapevine that Abagail had done it, and her mother was the laughing stock of the whole school.<BR>
        &quot;Like, how would you feel if someone had put a bit of roast dog in your food?&quot; said blonde Mary, to Mandy, &quot;People get really funny about what they will eat, but we all do it. My mother isn't unusual. It was a really nasty, lowdown trick by Abbey.&quot;<BR>
        The first years were having their meal together. As a special thank you Br Damian had cooked them a creamcake to go after. There was orange juice, and garlic mushroom starters, then the venison pastries, followed by the chocolate shortbreads.<BR>
        &quot;Why can't they do food like this all the time?&quot; asked Adam. <BR>
        &quot;Wasn't it funny&quot; said short Mary, in blonde Mary's hearing, &quot;when Mary's mother shrieked so? I really thought she was going to die.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Meat, meat&quot; said Abagail, &quot;Oh no, I've been poisoned by meat. A chunk of meat has touched my sacred lips.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;You are just so funny, Abbey&quot; said blonde Mary, shortly.<BR>
        &quot;We don't blame you for your mother&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;Abbey would have done it to anyone.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Anyone who shrieks&quot; said short Mary.  &quot;Oh come on&quot; said James, &quot;our one decent meal at St Tom's and you girls can't even enjoy it.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> Parents were kissed goodbye and left on the boat. Blonde Mary's mother, still recovering from the shock, was the last to go. Fr Abbot was most apologetic and plied her with finest Highland malt whiskey.<BR>
        &quot;It must have been a terrible misunderstanding in the kitchen&quot; he said, &quot;unfortunately our resources are stretched to the limit on these days, and I'm afraid things like this do happen. I am so sorry, and it is very embarrassing for Br Damian, but he is an old man. I hope you won't criticise him too harshly. We'll buy sealed dishes next time and open the seals in front of you, if you prefer. Rest assured this will not be allowed to happen again.&quot;</p>
        
        <p> A few hours later the prefects, who had been sitting at their own table, filed one by one into the sick bay, complaining of terrible stomach pangs.<BR>
        &quot;Food poisoning&quot; said Br Dominic, to Fr Abbot, &quot;Adam has done this before. It must be the same thing.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Matron says there are no serious symptoms&quot; said Fr Abbot, &quot;so at least Adam, if your suspicion is true, has learned to use milder poisons. But you know what this means? Letters to every single parent, warning them that there has been a case of food poisoning at the school, and asking for any other cases. It's a major headache.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;And someone must have put venison in blonde Mary's mother's pastry&quot; said Br Dominic, &quot;I do not for one moment believe that was an accident. We're going to have to get control of these first years.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;If the children are badly behaved the parents are the first ones to blame&quot; said Fr Abbot, &quot;but I can't afford to alienate a parent.</p>
        
        <p> The evening was blissfully free. The JC meeting was a debate on hunting.<BR>
        &quot;The fox will not die of old age&quot; said Sebastian, getting into his stride, &quot;people who know nothing of animals often think that. Which leads us to the central irony. It is those who live in towns, who don't know about animals, who don't like animals except as pets, who oppose hunting.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;It's a kind of cultural war against the countryside&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;my horse, Trumpert, was a hunter. Except we can't call him that. But what is he? A general riding animal? If you want to get from A to B, you use a car, we don't do 'general riding' anymore. Hunting is essential to the horse community. It's what you do with a horse, and now it is banned stables are closing. It's a real tragedy for country people.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Well I love animals,&quot; said Abagail, &quot;I love them as pets, I love to see them, and I love them to eat. But I don't agree with hunting foxes. You should only hunt for food, not for the enjoyment of it. And deer stalking isn't banned, nor is fishing. Just fox hunting. OK, I will admit that I was brought up in London. But don't imagine that we don't have foxes in London. So should we go after them with the local mutts, and make a kind of London tradition out of it? I don't think so.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;You don't eat foxes, but they are pests&quot;, said Cecilia, &quot;especially in the countryside.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I've nothing against pest control&quot; said Abagail, &quot;but in London it is done by Rentokill&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Order, order&quot; said Sean, &quot;you don't address each other directly but make all comments to the chair. Enough from first years. Do we have anyone else to oppose this motion?&quot;<BR>
        In the event it was pretty overwhelmingly defeated. There was a very vociferous countryside lobby led by people like Sebastian and Cecilia, but they were in the minority. The majority of children came from towns and suburbs, and there was a small animal rights group in the third year which had brought in pictures of mutilated foxes. So St Tom's Junior Calefactory voted to keep the government's ban in place.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Fifteen pounds a wrap? Rupert, no thanks&quot; it was Jade. Rupert put his wares away, defeated. Jade wouldn't give a reason, but it was obvious that she had undergone no moral conversion. Rupert realised that someone must be undercutting him, but he didn't know who, and he wasn't sure how to deal with it. However he knew that he must not stand by and tolerate it, either. Too much money was at stake.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;The best way to be safe from people sneaking on us&quot;, blonde Mary told Mandy, &quot;is for them to be customers. If they've used it too, they can't run to Fr Abbot. So we've got to make sure the rest of the dorm use it too. Now I don't anticipate any problems with Cecilia and Abbey, they're always game for a laugh. But we seem to have fallen out with short Mary.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I hate that sour bitch&quot; said Mandy.<BR>
        &quot;Well sometimes we've got to hide our feelings&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;that's what Mummy always tells me. I wouldn't put it past short Mary to sneak on us, then we two are in deep trouble, and I mean deep. She's going to find out about our little business, sooner or later, so we've got to make sure she is a user. Now how are we going to do that, given that she hates us?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Abbey and Cecilia might do it&quot; said Mandy, &quot;she likes them, unlike me. She won't want to miss out on anything they do.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I think that's the answer&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;we'll have a dorm party. Without short Mary.&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The next day, a letter landed on Fr Abbot's desk. It was wordprocessed, and written in a formal style.</p>
        
        <p> Dear Fr Abbot,  We the undersigned wish to make representation to you concerning the state of catering at St Thomas More monastic school.  As you will be aware, there was a recent case of food poisoning following the All Saints' day dinner. We are not opposed to the use of first years for various menial tasks around the school, including in the kitchen. Indeed such a policy may help overcome the chronic lack of resources in school catering. However we feel it is essential that they be properly supervised, particularly because of their immaturity and perhaps an immature attitude to hygiene. Currently the school lacks the kitchen staff to do this adequately.  The basic facilities also need improving, as does the standard of raw ingredients. It is fortunate that until now no serious incidents have arisen. However too often, we feel, the basic standard of preparation falls below that which we would expect from a school kitchen. In particular the policy of serving porridge for every breakfast needs review, and a wider range of dishes for dinner and lunch time, together with more care in cooking and preparation.  This is a formal complaint to you, sparked by but not limited to the recent unfortunate incidents.  Yours sincerely</p>
        
        <p> The prefects.</p>
        
        <p>Fr Abbot wrote back.</p>
        
        <p> My dear prefects,  I wish to make clear my deep distress at the recent incident of food poisoning. However such incidents occur from time to time in virtually all catering establishments. In this case, no further cases were uncovered and the problem appears to have been limited to one table, and though unfortunate is in no way indicative of a general failing in the kitchen.  We at St Thomas More monastic school currently enjoy leniency from the Benedictine prohibition on red meat. We should be grateful for our privileges. None of us has too little to eat. Maybe God is telling us something that, on a special feast day, contamination somehow crept in.  Br Damian tells me that he is satisfied with the performance of the first years during their recent kitchen duty. However I appreciate your anger that this incident has occurred.

        <p> With paternal care,  Guliemus Abbas</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Lucky to have anything to eat at all&quot; he said to himself, &quot;what have I taught them all these years?&quot;</p>
        
        <p> Abagail was acid. &quot;That was a completely pathetic trick.&quot; she said, &quot;Pretending to be ill so we get into trouble. Couldn't they have thought of anything better?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Well we're in trouble for it&quot; said James, &quot;It's Adam's fault. Poisoning Rupert is coming back, not just on you, on all six of us.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Well what could I do with Rupert?&quot; asked Adam.<BR>
        &quot;Stand up to him&quot; said James, &quot;man to man.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Well really.&quot; said Adam. &#96; &quot;Well he didn't try to bully me&quot; said James.<BR>
        &quot;Oh never mind&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;Abbey was right. The prefects are having their revenge.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;This means war,&quot; said Abagail, &quot;war between us and the prefects.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;As if&quot; said James, &quot;as if you can fight the prefects.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;You just wait and see&quot; said Abagail.</p>
        
        <p> Adam, Abagail, Albert, James, Sebastian and Cecilia were taken into the prefect's common room. A rubber mat, one of the ones used to prevent bed wetting, was on the floor.<BR>
        &quot;So, we're going to teach you a lesson&quot; said the head prefect, &quot;and no use running to Fr Abbot. He's given us the hint.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;We don't like poisoning at St Tom's&quot; said another, &quot;it's underhand, mean, and pathetic.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;We didn't poison you&quot; said Adam, &quot;it's a lie.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Oh, this one has attitude&quot; said the prefect, &quot;you first. Just so you know what it's like to be given poison.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Grab him&quot; said the head prefect.<BR>
        Two prefects took hold of Adam.<BR>
        &quot;Now drink this&quot;, a pint of water was forced down Adam's throat. It was salty and vinegary.<BR>
        &quot;Swing him&quot;<BR>
        Adam feebly tried to protest as he was grabbed by the feet, and swung upside down. Coins and sweets spilled from his pockets. A violent feeling rubbed at the pit of his stomach. Still held upside down, he was violently sick, but his stomach wouldn't expel the water properly because of the position. The vomit remained in his mouth. He vomited again, and began to choke.<BR>
        &quot;Put him up&quot; said a prefect.<BR>
        Adam was restored to his feet. He was feeling sick again. He was sick all over his uniform.<BR>
        &quot;Now you know what it feels like&quot; said a prefect. &quot;Next one.&quot;<BR>
        It was James. The same treatment was handed out to him, then Sebastian, and Albert, and Abagail and Cecilia in turn.<BR>
        &quot;Now clean it up. Uniform inspection in two hours.&quot;<BR>
        The room was awash with vomit, and it was all over their clothes. The rubber sheet had protected the carpet, but only just.<BR>
        &quot;What with?&quot; asked Abagail.<BR>
        The prefects handed them a toothbrush each.<BR>
        &quot;This is gross&quot; said Cecilia, kneeling down to scrub the vomit from the sheet.  &quot;I am going to be sick again&quot; said Adam, and promptly was.<BR>
        It was horrible.<BR>
        &quot;We'll never hear the last of that blasted boat trip&quot; said Cecilia.<BR>
        &quot;Just a bit of seasickness shouldn't put you off sailing&quot; said Sebastian.</p>
        
        <p> &quot;Mandy, keep a watch for short Mary&quot; said blonde Mary, as Abagail and Cecilia returned to the dorm, &quot;those prefects were awful to you, weren't they, dears?. However we've got something to settle you.&quot;  &quot;What?&quot; asked Abagail.<BR>
        &quot;It's a herb. It does for nausea&quot; said blonde Mary.<BR>
        &quot;I'd do anything to feel less sick&quot; said Abagail.<BR>
        Blonde Mary produced a roll, and lit it. It smelt sweet.<BR>
        &quot;Try this&quot; she said.<BR>
        &quot;I don't smoke&quot; said Abagail.<BR>
        &quot;It's not a cigarette&quot; said blonde Mary, and took a puff, &quot;it relaxes you. You just take a few puffs, not the whole thing like you would with a cigarette.&quot; she held the burning stick, &quot;can't you feel it relaxing you already?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;To be honest my stomach feels better already&quot; said Abagail. <BR>
        &quot;You have to inhale to get the full effect. Just a little bit.&quot; she took another puff, &quot;see, like this.&quot;<BR>
        Abagail took the roll and sucked on it tentatively. Smoke flooded into her lungs and distracted her form her sickening stomach. She took another, deeper breath.<BR>
        &quot;I feel better already, thanks Mary.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Cecilia?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I'll try this medicine, but only once.&quot; said Cecilia.<BR>
        &quot;It's perfect for whenever you feel sick.&quot;<BR>
        Cecilia took a puff.<BR>
        &quot;Mandy, how is the door?&quot; asked blonde Mary<BR>
        &quot;All clear&quot; said Mandy.<BR>
        &quot;You can just risk a brief go&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;but don't let the smoke into the corridor.&quot; <BR>
        Mandy took a breath, blowing the smoke back into the dorm.<BR>
        The three girls sat on the floor.<BR>
        &quot;Sorry, Mary, about your mother&quot; said Abagail.<BR>
        &quot;Oh, don't worry&quot; said blonde Mary, &quot;it was a good trick. No hard feelings.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I told her to do it&quot; said Cecilia, &quot;we should have asked you, Mary.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;It was short Mary put us up to it&quot; said Abagail. <BR>
        &quot;As I thought&quot; said blonde Mary.<BR>
        The girls made peace. The roll was soon smoked down to a stub.<BR>
        &quot;Get the smoke out before short Mary comes in&quot; said blonde Mary.<BR>
        They rolled down the dorm window as far as it would go, and cleared the air.<BR>
        &quot;It's cold here&quot; said short Mary, coming in, &quot;what's happened to the heating?&quot;<BR>
        The other girls, getting ready for bed, ignored her. For the first time, short Mary felt totally isolated.</p>
        
        <p> Meanwhile the boys broke into their stash of wine after lights out.<BR>
        &quot;You lucky thing, Ibrahim&quot; said Adam, &quot;you didn't have to go through that.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Cleaning up vomit. It was awful.&quot; said Albert.<BR>
        &quot;Sickening&quot; said Sebastian.<BR>
        &quot;Anyway, it's over now and we need to relax. Honey will sooth an upset stomach&quot; said Adam.<BR>
        &quot;Gorgeous honey&quot; said James.<BR>
        &quot;Taste the sweetness of food after lights out&quot; said Adam.<BR>
        &quot;We've no corkscrew&quot; said Albert.<BR>
        &quot;Never mind&quot; said James, &quot;you just push the cork in. It doesn't spoil the wine.&quot;<BR>
        Using the back of a knife they pushed the cork right down. It took two of them, Albert and Sebastian holding, and James pressing down with all his body weight. The cork went in with a pop.<BR>
        &quot;Hurray&quot; cheered Adam.<BR>
        &quot;Shut up&quot; said James.<BR>
        &quot;It's best with a bit of water&quot; said Adam.<BR>
        &quot;How do you know?&quot; asked James.<BR>
        &quot;We had it that way with Cecilia's dad.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;It's considered the height of sophistication in some circles&quot; said Sebastian.<BR>
        &quot;OK&quot; said James.<BR>
        Adam poured some of the wine into a tooth glass. Then he added a small amount of water from the tap. He raised his eyes to heaven and said<BR>
        &quot;Blessed art thou, O God, King of the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Amen&quot; said the other boys.<BR>
        Adam took a sip and passed the cup on to James. The cup went round and round until it was exhausted, the it was topped up with more water and wine.<BR>
        &quot;It tastes interesting&quot; said Ibrahim.<BR>
        &quot;This is good stuff&quot; said Sebastian, &quot;they do things properly, for the parents at least. No cheap plonk at St Tom's&quot;<BR>
        &quot;We could do with something with it&quot; said Albert.<BR>
        &quot;Almost forgot&quot; said Sebastian, he went to his locker and produced a packet of biscuits. &quot;Bath Olivers. I bought them when I went out with my parents the other day. You bite them between glasses, to take the taste away. Say grace over these, Adam.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Oh come on&quot; said Ibrahim.<BR>
        &quot;It would be tempting fate not to&quot; said Sebastian.<BR>
        James put his finger to his lips. There was a footstep outside the door, then silence.<BR>
        &quot;One of the second years&quot; said Albert, &quot;I can tell Fr Dominic. He walks with very precise, even steps, not like that.&quot;<BR>
        They waited for a while in silence.<BR>
        &quot;Blessed art thou O God, King of the universe&quot; said Adam, &quot;who creates for us all kinds of food&quot; he gave each boy a Bath Oliver.<BR>
        &quot;Is one bottle enough?&quot; asked Albert.<BR>
        &quot;For the first time&quot; said Adam, &quot;we've got plenty left.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;You get sick if you drink too much&quot; said Sebastian.<BR>
        &quot;I've been sick enough today already&quot; said Albert.<BR>
        The empty bottle was replaced in its hiding place amongst the others, and the carpet drawn over it again. The boys went to sleep contented, the bitterness of the encounter with the prefects washed away.<BR>
        It was porridge for breakfast again.<BR>
        &quot;I've finished my lobster pot&quot; said Albert.<BR>
        &quot;What took so long?&quot; asked Adam.<BR>
        &quot;Tying all the knots for the net&quot; said Albert, &quot;then I've been making rabbit traps and on kitchen duty every evening. It's finally done at last. However somehow I don't think the prefects will take me out in a boat to try it out.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;You're right, I don't think they'd like that idea&quot; said Adam.<BR>
        &quot;I like venison&quot; said Abagail, spooning runny porridge from her bowl.<BR>
        &quot;Ask brother Damian&quot; said Adam.<BR>
        &quot;The forests about here are full of it&quot; said Abagail.<BR>
        &quot;You need rifles to stalk deer&quot; said Albert, &quot;and where would we steal some rifles?&quot;<BR>
        &quot;I was thinking we could be like Robin Hood and the Merry Men&quot; said Abagail, &quot;they used to eat the King's deer. And they had bows and arrows.&quot;<BR>\  Adam looked at Albert.<BR>
        &quot;I don't know&quot; said Albert, &quot;it's possible.&quot;<BR>
        &quot;Abbey&quot;, said Adam, &quot;let's see if we can organise a deer hunt.&quot;</p>
