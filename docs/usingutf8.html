<H1> Using the Baby X UTF-8 utility functions </H1>
<P>
The Baby X UTF-8 utility functions are a simple set of functions which 
make 
it easy to manipulate UTF-8. All Baby X API functions which accept a char 
* accept UTF-8. The functions are easy to use and efficient.   
</P>
<H3> What is UTF-8 </H3>
<P>
Unicode is a character encoding which represents all the glyphs in common 
use in human languages. So not just English letters, like ASCII, but also 
Greek and Arabic and Japnenese and so on. It was originally thought that 
64,000 characters would be enough, and so the original version of Unicode 
was a 16-bit character set. This proved to be a big mistake. More than 
64,000 characters were needed. And there was a massive amount of legacy 
code which expected stringsin ASCII, and couldn't work with 16-bit wide 
characters.
 </P>
<P>
So to address these probles, UTF-8 was invented. It is backwards 
compatible with ASCII. So every ASCII string is also a valid UTF-8 
string. However ASCII is only a seven bit encoding, whilst bytes have 
eight bits. So UTF-8 exploits the extra high bit. If the high bit is 
set, the character is part of a multi-byte encoding of a Unicode value 
greater than 127. The higher the value, the more bytes used. There might 
be one (for ASCII), two, three, or even four UTF-8 bytes used to encode a 
single Unicode value, or "code point".
 </P>
<P>
You don't have to know the details of how UTF-8 works to use the Baby X 
utility functions successfully, but for the curious, here are the details:

0xxxxxxx - ASCII character
1xxxxxxx - Part of a multibyte character

 <P>
 The bits included in the byte sequence is biased by the minimum value
 so that if all the z's, y's, x's, w's, and v's are zero, the minimum
 value is represented.	In the byte sequences, the lowest-order encoded
 bits are in the last byte; the high-order bits (the z's) are in the
 first byte.
 </P>
 <P>
An easy way to remember this transformation format is to note that the
 number of high-order 1's in the first byte is the same as the number of
 subsequent bytes in the multibyte character:
