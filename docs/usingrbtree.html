<H1> Using the Red-Black Tree </H1>
<P>
The Baby X resource compiler contains a flexible and re-usable 
implementation of a Red-Black tree.
</P>
<H3> What is a Red-Black Tree? </H3>
<P>
A red-black tree is a balanced binary search tree. It is used for 
maintaining a list of sorted items that is constantly being updated. 
Calling qsort() every time a new item was inserted into a sorted list 
would be prohibitively expensive.
 </P> 
<P>
The red-black tree is a binary tree with the property that if it walked in 
depth-first order (left child before parent, then parent, then right 
child), it will return the elements in sorted order. Our implemention 
takes a qsort() style comparison function to compare the keys. Our 
implementation also uses separate keys and elements. The keys are sorted. 
The key might or might not be field of the element.
 </P>
<P>
The tree can be searched in O(log N) time, because half the data is 
eliminated every time a node is visited. 
</P>
<P>
A naive implementation of a binary search tree suffers from the
disadvantage 
that, as elements are inserted and deleted, the tree will tend to 
degenerate into a linked list. So a red-black tree imposes rules on the 
structure to keep the tree reasonably balanced. 
 </P>
<OL>
    <LI> Every node is either red or black. </LI>
    <LI> All NIL nodes (empty leaves)  are considered black. </LI>
    <LI> A red node does not have a red child. </LI>
    <LI> Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes 
goes 
through the same number of black nodes. </LI>
    <LI> (Conclusion) If a node N has exactly one child, it must be a red 
child, because if it were black, its NIL descendants <BR> would sit at a  
different black depth than N's NIL child, violating requirement 4. </LI> 
</OL>
<P>
Every time we insert or detete an element, we must fix up the tree to 
maintain these rules. This can be done by examining a few local nodes in 
the vicinity of the change

<P>
It is not necessary to access the structures directly to use the red-black 
tree, but they are shown to help understanding. To simplify the fix-up 
logic a  bit on insertions or deletions, leaves are set to the "sentinel" 
node instead of the NULL pointer.

<P>
Here the data and the key are the same structures. This is sometimes what 
you want. Other times, you want to access the data via a short key. The 
RBTREE does not own either the data or the keys, so if they are allocated 
via dynamic memory you will have to walk the tree to collect the pointers, 
then delete in second pass (you can't delete keys whilst walking the tree, 
as this will put it in an inconsistent state)

<P>
This is how to destroy an RBTREE. The difficulty is that you can't walk 
the tree deleting as you go, because that would put the tree into an 
inconsistent state.
