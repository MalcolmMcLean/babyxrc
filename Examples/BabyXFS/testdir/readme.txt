FileSystem test files

These are files designed to test the system.

text/whitespace contains files consisting entirely of white space.
text/newlines contains files with surrounding newlines and other space.
text/src contains the program used to generate the test files.
text/books.xml is an xml file

binary/images/Cartoon_Owl_clip_art.png is an image of an owl
binary.*.bin
   all1to127.bin - all bytes 1 127 ascending
   allbytes.bin - all bytes 0 to 255 ascending
   allunder128.bin - all bytes 0 - 128 ascending
   zeros_12.bin - 12 zero bytes

See if you can extract these correctly with the program directory.

Have fun.

Malcolm.
