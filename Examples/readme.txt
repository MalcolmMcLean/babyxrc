Here are some example files to show how to use the
resource compiler, also test it.

AminoInvaders is a little fun biochemistry game project
that includes the amino acids. Amino acid gif files were
nicked from the web. They are too large for the game, so
they are resized slightly. Then dumped as 32 bit rgbas.

I've also added a cursor and an SVG file to demonstrate
the system.
